            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Papers (ſome ſheets of which, I two years ſince took the freedom to ſhew you) had, within ſome few Weeks after your ſight of them,
<pb facs="tcp:57881:3"/>waited upon you in this dreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which now the Printer has put them, if the Plague had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed my intentions, which, coming to the Town where I liv'd, forc'd me from my Houſe and Studies, having not (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) courage enough, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my ſelf and Family to the mercy of ſo diſmall a Diſeaſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, flight is the onely infallible preſervative.</p>
            <p>My occaſions ſince have been ſo many and preſſing, that I have had little leiſure to collect my ſcatter'd Papers, and therefore, I muſt intreat your pardon, as well for the ſlow performance of my promiſe, as for whatever elſe you ſhall meet with in the Treatiſe, which may ſtand in need of it.</p>
            <p>My deſign is, to ſhew, that though the <hi>Phyſiology</hi> and <hi>Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57881:3"/>of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> ought to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled according to the new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in Anatomy, and the Democritical and Chymical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, yet that many of the Rules, Methods, and Medicines, which more immediately reſpect the uſeful and practical part, are ſtill to be retained, and that they are rather more reconcileable to the Modern, than they were to the Ancient <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, the practical part of <hi>Phyſick</hi> being grounded upon Experience, does not ſo much depend upon the notional, that, this being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, the other muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground. The fancies and reaſonings of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians</hi> were built upon the practiſe, and ſignifie not much more to the Fundamentals of the Art of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> than pinnacles to
<pb facs="tcp:57881:4"/>the body and foundation of a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which (though they be blown down) may ſtand unſhaken.</p>
            <p>Much of the Therapeutick part of <hi>Phyſick</hi> is like Dialls and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacks, which agree as well with that of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> as <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>'s <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> For as the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents made a true uſe of the light and heat of the Sun, in diſtinguiſhing and meaſuring Times and Seaſons, and managing of their Husbandry, though probably they err'd in their Notion of his motion round the Earth; ſo did <hi>Phyſitians</hi> no leſſe, happily, imploy <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Art in the curing of Diſeaſes, though they were ignorant of the true motion of the Blood, and of (the Sun of the <hi>Microcoſm</hi>) the Heart.</p>
            <p>It is (I know) objected, To what end have been all theſe new Diſcoveries in <hi>Phyſick;</hi> and to
<pb facs="tcp:57881:4"/>what purpoſe is a farther Inquiry, if the practiſe be not altered by them? But to this Objection it may be eaſily anſwered, that though many of the Rules, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and Medicins of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents be ſtill in force, and muſt be made uſe of in the curing of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; yet, when we conſider, that in this Art, there muſt be much left to the judgment and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and the applying of the Methods, and Remedies ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to mens particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, it will appear, that an Artiſt (who proceeds from true principles) is as much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before a bare practitioner, as a good Architect before a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bricklayer, or Maſon, who, though by his practice, he has learnt
<pb facs="tcp:57881:5"/>to build a Wall, or a ſtack of Chimneys, will be neceſſarily at a loſſe in deſigning a great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Fabrick.</p>
            <p>It is (I confeſſe) an abſurd temper to be ſo moroſe, ſo addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to authority and antiquity, as to ſhut our eyes, leſt they ſhould diſcern a new Truth, and rather disbelieve our own Senſes than the Writings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi> But, on the other hand, the humor is no leſſe ridiculous, to put on the ſame levity in matters of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Phyſick,</hi> as we do in <hi>Clothes,</hi> to like nothing which is not of a new faſhion, to have a greater eſteem for Error and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe in a modiſh Garb, than Truth and Wiſdom in an old-faſhioned Dreſs. Though we ſee farther than the Ancients did, we muſt acknowledge, that we ſtand upon
<pb facs="tcp:57881:5"/>their Shoulders; and, if we will be ingenuous, that we are the Dwarfs and they the Giants.</p>
            <p>We need not (I think) in our age, apprehend any danger to <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> from an over-fondneſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. The growing evil is the other Extream, a fancy of rejecting the wiſdome of the Ancients, for the follies and whimſies of ſome phantaſtical <hi>Pſeudo-chymiſts,</hi> which is, like the <hi>Americans,</hi> to barter Gold and Silver, for Beads and Glaſs.</p>
            <p>Sir, Our Nation is of late grown as fond of Enthuſiaſts in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> as they were of thoſe in <hi>Divinity;</hi> and Ignorance (amongſt ſome men) is become as neceſſary a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the practiſe of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> as it us'd to be for <hi>Preaching.</hi> I cannot believe, that the delight which the Vulgar (ray, and ſome Wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:57881:6"/>men) take in being cheated by <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> proceeds from any principle in Nature, which inclines them to it. But rather think it to be caus'd from Impoſtours being more induſtrious in deluding the World, than the true Artiſts in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving it.</p>
            <p>There has of late been one of them wondrous buſie in poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rabble (to whoſe capacity his Diſcourſe is ſuited) againſt the learned <hi>Phyſitians</hi> of the Colledge of <hi>London,</hi> and all others, who have been bred up, and taken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities.</hi> He puts them into his own Bears skin, and then baits them. He would make the World believe, that they are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of narrow ſtreight-lac'd men, who onely confine themſelves to Books, and never ſtudy Nature, and that they ſtifle and ſuppreſs all
<pb facs="tcp:57881:6"/>occaſions of improving their Art. I do not wonder, that they meet with ſo ill uſage at his hands, whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and profeſsion it has been for above twenty years, to libel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all ſacred and honourable perſons of this Nation. I have in this Treatiſe, endeavored to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them from his falſe aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by ſhewing them to have been Authors of the New Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Diſcoveries in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and the great Promoters of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> By the way, I have thought it not improper, to make ſome reflections upon the Book of this bold and impertinent invader of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and plauſible vender of very popular non-ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The truth is, both <hi>Mercurius Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticus,</hi> the Author of <hi>Medela,</hi> and his Book, are ſo inconſiderable, that they deſerve not to be treated
<pb facs="tcp:57881:7"/>with any reſpect, eſpecially, ſince himſelf ſo inhumanly tramples up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aſhes of the Ancients, at that wild rate flings dirt upon the learnedſt Society of <hi>Phyſitians</hi> in the World, and libels the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,</hi> not only in his Book, but in his pretenſions to have had his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation in them.</p>
            <p>Yet, my deſign is not ſo much to concern my ſelf in the man, or his ſcurrilous expreſsions, as to take occaſion from thoſe material points in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> which he has ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idly and extravagantly ſtated, to treat of them more cloſely and pertinently, according to the beſt and trueſt grounds of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Phyſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I have ſo far preſum'd upon your friendſhip, as not only to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with the reading but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of this Treatiſe. If it be

Hiſtories are full of the frequent Tragedies which have been acted by <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> in adminiſtring Medicins, whoſe Nature and Power they underſtood not. About Two years ſince, having viſited my honoured, learned Friend, Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian in Ordinary to His Majeſty, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me, That he had been lately cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who, upon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Vomit from an <hi>Emperick,</hi> and a <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percatharſis</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57881:20"/>enſuing upon it, fell into diſmal Convulſions; in which, in deſpite of the moſt proper Remedies, he dyed. I do not wonder, that theſe ſad Effects do often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, upon the taking of <hi>Phyſick</hi> from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Men: For the Univerſal Medicin of the <hi>Empericks</hi> being uſually ſome or other ill preparation of <hi>Antimony</hi> in ſubſtance, if it chance not to paſs upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but ſtick in the Coats of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, or be entangled in ſome tough viſcous Matter, it being the Nature of that Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to communicate a vomiting quality, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has impregnated ſeveral Infuſions; no wonder, if lying in the Stomack, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually imparts to the juyces, which flow thither out of the maſs of blood, for a <hi>menſtruum</hi> to diſſolve the Meat, and to thoſe Liquors which are taken in by the mouth, an emetick virtue, till the Patient, at length, has vomited up his Soul. Upon this Score, I do not find, that many <hi>Phyſitians</hi> are very forward in uſing <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> eſpecially in Pills or a ſolid Form; which though I have us'd, and ſeen us'd with good Succeſs; yet, I judge it, given in Subſtance, not ſo ſafe: and nothing more effectual, than the Infuſion of that excellent good preparation of <hi>Antimony, Crocus Metallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> which (though it be to be met with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57881:21"/>in the Road of Diſpenſatories) with <hi>M. N</hi>'s good leave, is no contemptible Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. How much, in Medicins, Experience is to be valued, and how like a Toleration of Aſſaſſinates it will look, to allow a Liberty to every <hi>Quack</hi> to make Experiments upon Mens bodies, will farther appear, if we conſider, That the mixing of Things harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in themſelves, may ſometimes produce a Poyſon. Thus out of <hi>Vitriol, Salt, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and <hi>Niter,</hi> is made Sublimate; of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Niter,</hi> and <hi>Allum, Aqua Fortis;</hi> which, though made of innocent Ingredients, are Mixtures moſt deſtructive to the Body of Man. And, I know not why in other Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the ſame thing may not come to paſs, which may never be conſidered by a bold and unwary Experimenter of Medicins; nor known, but at the price of a Murder.</p>
               <p>In the next place, There is an abſolute Neceſſity, that he who will venture to give <hi>Phyſick,</hi> be able to judge of the Strength and Conſtitution of the Sick perſon whom he undertakes, if he expects with Safety and Succeſs to manage the matter. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in a Dialogue, introduces <hi>Phaedrius</hi> and <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> diſcourſing to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Socrat: <hi>If any one ſhould tell me, Truly I know how to apply theſe things to the Body, with which I can (when I pleaſe) make it hot or

               <p>IN his ſecond Chapter, <hi>M.N.</hi> pretends to prove, That there is ſo great an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Diſeaſes of this preſent time, from what they were in former, as to make void and uſeleſs the whole Art of <hi>Phyſick</hi> deliver'd down to us from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients: But I do not queſtion to make it appear, That the difference in Diſeaſes both in relation to time and place, is not ſo great as he would make it; nor ſo conſiderable, but that a rational <hi>Phyſitian</hi> may make very good uſe of their Methods, Rules, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicins, in the Time and Countrey wherein we live.</p>
               <p>I do not at all queſtion, that Diſeaſes here in <hi>England,</hi> are ſomething different from thoſe of the ſame kind in <hi>Greece, Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and that they may in ſome particulars vary from the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons left us by the Antients, by reaſon that the Countries wherein they liv'd, and made their Obſervations, have a very different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Bodies and Conſtitutions of the Inhabitants of thoſe parts, from what ours have upon us. But, that the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57881:25"/>is to be aſcribed to the alteration in time, rather than the difference of Climate and Dyet, I very much doubt. I think it no very abſurd thing to believe, That Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here in <hi>England</hi> obſerved the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and afflicted men with the ſame Symptoms which now they do, even in the time of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or <hi>Galen;</hi> only allowing, that ſome Chronical Diſtempers may be ſomewhat altered by the change of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But as to Epidemical Diſeaſes, I ſuppoſe that then, as now, they differ'd almoſt every Year according to the variety of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and temperature of the ſeaſons; and according to the impreſſions which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the qualities of the ſeveral Years made upon the blood, no leſs in their times, than ours, their Epidemical Feavers were accompanied with odd and new Symptoms. I know well, the <hi>French Diſeaſe</hi> is ſince come in upon us from <hi>America;</hi> but, that there is no body now free from a ſpice of it, and that it bears a great ſhare in all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, I have ſo much reſpect for my Countrey, and Mankind, as to think, That
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57881:25"/>no man but <hi>M. N.</hi> will aſſert, who (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) meaſures every mans body by his own; and like an Icterical man, ſees all Objects yellow, becauſe his own eyes are of that colour.</p>
               <p>As to his inſtance in Agues, which, he ſayes, give the greateſt bafflle to <hi>Phyſitians;</hi> I ſuppoſe thoſe baffled perſons, to be men of his Rank, and Ability in <hi>Phyſick.</hi> For I have found it by ſundry Experiments to be moſt true, That a <hi>Tertian</hi> may be cured as eaſily and conſtantly as any other Diſeaſe, if a right method be obſerv'd, before the blood be too much depraved by ill Diet, or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>Phyſick.</hi>

               <p>The Author of <hi>Medela</hi> could not have pitched upon a Diſeaſe more unluckily for himſelf, there being no Diſtemper which ſuits more exactly with the deſcriptions of the ancient <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> than this.

That the Scurvy conſiſts in the Bloods being degenerated from its ſpirituous Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick, and volatilized condition, into a ſalt, ſharp, and auſtere Liquor, wherein the volatil Spirits are either evapotated, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt; and the groſs Salts either being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd from the reſt of the Principles, run together, and are ſaid to be in the ſtate of Fluidity, or continuing only their Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with the earthy parts of the Blood, render it wholly fixed and unactive; in which ſtates it becomes either ſharp and eager, like Vineger, or dead and flat,

From which difference of Niters in the Air, I conclude, That the firing of the blood in the Heart, and the fermentation of it afterwards in the Veſſels, may be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified, as to cauſe all the Symptoms ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the Scurvy. It is farther to be Noted, That the chief Specificks uſed in the cure of this Diſeaſe, are ſuch, which perform their effect by the volatil Salt with which they abound, and with which they impregnate the flat and languiſhing blood; ſuch are generally all things which ſtrike the Tongue and Noſe with a quick, ſmart, and brisk taſte and ſmell; which though they for the preſent give relief, and change the habit of the body to the better, yet do they ſeldom make ſo perfect a cure, but that upon the intermiſſion of the uſe of them, the Air, by its ill Impreſſions, reduces in ſhort time the blood to the Scorbutick, or Saline Dyſcraſie, from which it is no longer able to defend its ſelf, than it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the nimble, and volatil Salts of thoſe anti-Scorbutick Remedies. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſe then of this Endemial Diſeaſe the Scurvy, being the conſtitution of the Air is peculiar to the Northern parts of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57881:31"/>World, and there appearing no reaſon why we ſhould believe that to be altered for the worſe in our times, from what it was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; I ſhall be apt to conclude, That it alwayes had the ſame effects upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of thoſe men who breathed it, and that anciently, as well as in our times, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Scurvy in thoſe Bodies; which through Errors in Dyet, want of Exerciſe, or antecedent Diſeaſes, it found diſpoſed to receive it.</p>
               <p>As to the increaſe of it of late in the Bills of Mortality (as that ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> has obſerved) I ſuppoſe, ſince the Scurvy has been familiarly taken notice of, and diſcourſed by the <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> (which has not been long) the name has from them been deriv'd down to the Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers and Searchers; and is grown ſo common in their mouths, that Diſeaſes which either they underſtand not, or have a mind to conceal, are now often given in under the name of the Scurvy.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Stopping of the Stomack,</hi> I can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to be nothing elſe but the Diſeaſe which <hi>Phyſitians</hi> call <hi>Asthma,</hi> or <hi>Dyſpnaea,</hi> becauſe I find not the leaſt mention of this very frequent Malady in the Weekly Bills; and that I obſerve there is nothing more uſual with the Vulgar in their complaints to <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> than to aſſign thoſe Diſtempers to their ſtomacks, which properly belong to their Lungs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Riſing of the Lights,</hi> is (I think) truly enough believed by <hi>M. N.</hi> to be, that frequent Symptom, which is vulgarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Suffocatio uterina,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

And I am not of Opinion, that that Suffocation is only the proper affect of Women, and that ſolely it is cauſed from the diſturbance of the Womb: For I have ſeen ſome men very much troubled with a riſing up in their Throats, and eſpecially in Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal Diſtempers, no leſs apprehenſive of being choaked, than Hyſterical Wo-</p>

               <p>It is worth the taking notice of in this place, that the Author of <hi>Medela,</hi> who everywhere elſe inveighs ſo bitterly againſt the <hi>Ariſtotelean</hi> and <hi>Galenick Philoſophy,</hi> when he pretends to give ſome account of the reaſons and cauſes of theſe Symptoms, for want of truer apprehenſions of his own, ſhelters himſelf under the very weakeſt, and moſt exploded part of that Philoſophy.

                  <p>THough the Diſeaſe called <hi>Hysterica Paſſio,</hi> be by almoſt all Authors treated of as only peculiar to Women, and proceeding only from the diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Womb; yet (as I have before obſerved) it may, upon grounds drawn from Reaſon and Experience, be very truly affirmed, That Men alſo are liable to moſt of the Symptoms of it, and that even in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they are often cauſed when the Womb is not in the leaſt concern'd in the guilt. And the reaſon, why this Sex is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than that other, afflicted with this Malady, may very well be aſcribed to their more delicate conſtitution, and ſoft texture
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57881:33"/>of their nervous parts, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more liable to convulſive motions; and upon the vellicating and twitching of any one part endued with exquiſite ſenſe, to have Convulſions communicated to the whole nervous Syſtem from whence the whole frame of the Body is put into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; as we ſee Clocks and Watches, whoſe Springs and Wheels are contriv'd with too ſubtil and nice workmanſhip, are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in fault, than thoſe of more plain work.</p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Diſeaſe, and of the Cauſes from whence all the Symptoms do flow, it will not be improper to give thoſe Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of it which are delivered by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and of the Accidents which in ſome particular perſons have occurr'd to my own obſervation. The Paroxyſms, or Fits of this Diſeaſe, in ſome move regularly, and return at certain ſet-times; in others, are uncertain, and wandring. Some perſons they invade in an inſtant; in others, they give notice and warning by certain ſigns, which forerun the Fit, and are a Prologue to the Tragedy. As a dulneſs of Spirits, Lazineſs, Faintneſs, Paleneſs of Face, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Countenance. The Parties preſs their Belly with their hands, and perceive
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57881:34"/>ſomething to riſe up, to their apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as big as a Cannon-Bullet; their Legs fail them, and tremble; they find ſomething riſe up to their Throat, ready to choke them. Then they grow drowſie, loſe their underſtanding; ſome laugh, others weep; ſome, do both: Beſides, they find a gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain at the mouth of their Stomack, a loathing of Meat, a pain and Swelling of their Belly, a rumbling in their Sides under the Ribs. They have a weak Pulſe, a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the Heart, a pain in the Head, a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their Lips, Face and Eyes; which are ſometimes diſtorted, ſometimes ſo faſt ſhut, that they can hardly be opened: And being now high in the Fit, they are ready to be ſtrangled, are deprived of Voice, Senſe, and Motion, except ſuch as is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive; ſome cry out with a deſpairing Voice, and preſently fall down for dead; their Pulſe is then very weak, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times none to be felt. When the Fit is going off, their Cheeks redden, they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Senſes; their Eyes, with a very dull and heavy Aſpect, are opened; and at length, fetching deep ſighs, and ſometimes pouring forth ſhowres of tears, they come to themſelves. This is the Picture of that diſmal Diſeaſe which moſt frequently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts poor miſerable Women (though Men
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57881:34"/>are not exempted from it.) In ſome, all or moſt of theſe Symptoms meet; in others, only the ſtrangling, or danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choked, with ſome other Accidents, are obſervable. But generally, the Fits are ſo terrible, and amazing to them, who conſider not the reaſons of theſe affections, that by the Vulgar, the perſons ſubject to them, are believed to be bewitched, or poſſeſſed by the Devil.</p>

And I am ſo much of his Opinion, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That very often a Dyſcraſie, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Blood, and probably of the Serum or Whey of it, is one cauſe of this Diſtemper. But I beg his pardon, if I am apt to believe, That even then, when theſe Fits are cauſed from a Serous Dyſcraſie in the Blood, they are rather to be attributed to the Impurities and ſharp Salts which are either caſt off upon the Brain, and from thence diſtributed through the Nerves into remote parts of the Body; or elſe upon ſome of the Bowels, where thoſe pungent juices pricking and vellicating the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nerves, cauſe the original and whole ſyſtem to participate of their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; than to the Bloods ſtuffing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtending the Veſſels of the Lungs, and Heart. For beſides, that there are many Women Cachectical and Hydropical, whoſe Veſſels are filled with little elſe but wateriſh Blood and Whey, who are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57881:37"/>very free from Fits of the Mother; It is often obſerved, that Women of a ruddy Complexion, who have a brisk and lively heat in their Blood, and that rich with ſpirits, which purges its ſelf every Month in its conſtant periods, are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten miſerably afflicted with Hyſterical Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxyſms: For they are not ſeldom ſuch as have an excellent good appetite, and digeſt their meat well; whoſe Lungs are not flab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, weak, or diſpoſed to a Conſumption; and whoſe Blood, when it is let out of their Veins, and ſetled, is obſerved to be thick, and full of Fibers; all which are Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations quite contrary to thoſe which are required by Dr. <hi>Highmore</hi>'s Hypotheſis, (if I miſtake him not) to render a perſon liable to Hyſterical Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>Moreover (in my Opinion) crude and wateriſh Blood is altogether unfit to be ſet ſo impetuouſly on fire, as to cauſe ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant a Fermentation in the Ventricles of the Heart, that by overſtretching the Lungs, they ſhould be unable to disburden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Blood. For we find, that Cachectical and Hydropical perſons, and Maids in the Green-Sickneſs, are troubled with a ſhortneſs of Breath upon Exerciſe, and walking up ſteep Places or Stairs, which undoubtedly is cauſed, for that the Blood
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57881:37"/>of ſuch perſons being thin and wateriſh, and wanting its due proportion of the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and inflammable part, does not afford a ſufficient quantity of vital Oyl to the Lamp of the Heart; and therefore when upon exerciſe and motion, there is a greater quantity of Blood than ordinarily ſent into the Heart, that being not well ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and fired in the right Ventricle, paſſes not ſo ſwiftly through the Lungs to theleft, as it ought, to make room for that which is to ſucceed; ſo that at the ſame time the Lungs and Heart are overburdened, upon which a difficulty of Breathing, &amp; a beating and throbbing at the Heart muſt neceſſarily enſue. Beſides, in Feavers, where the Blood is moſt of all rarified, and fermented (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the matter of the Diſeaſe be caſt upon the Brain) Hyſterical Symptoms do not conſtantly happen; and yet the ſulphuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of the Blood fired, is much more apt to fill and diſtend the Chambers of the Heart, and Veſſels of the Lungs, than the Whey.</p>
                  <p>It is farther obſervable, That Women, who have their Courſes too frequently, and vent by the Womb overgreat quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Blood, are often troubled with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical Fits; and ſome even after ſo large Haemorrhages, that there has been more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57881:38"/>Reaſon to believe, they had not Blood enough left to maintain the Circulation, than to ſuſpect the Lungs and Heart could be oppreſſed with it. <hi>Riverius</hi> has an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a Maid,

                  </p>
                  <p>Having hitherto prov'd, That the Animal Conſtitution is primarily affected in the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical Paſſion, it will follow, that theremay be aſſigned as many cauſes of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as we can imagine able either notably to vellicate the Extremities of the Nervs, &amp; affect them ſo ſtrongly, as to draw into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the whole Syſtem, or elſe to put the Animal Spirits in the Brain into ſo great a confuſion and diſorder, as to diſturb their conſtant and regular irradiation and influx into the bowels, and other parts of the body: Or, whatever cauſes are apt to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <p>The Ancients reckon the Seed retained in the genital parts in too great a quantity, as one of the principal cauſes of theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and that we may the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how that is able to put the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits and Nerves into diſorderly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it will not be impertinent to conſider the nature of it.

                  <p>The Sum of what this learned perſon aſſerts, is, That nitro-ſulphureous Spirits, or Salts, are, as it were, the Soul of the World, and the Authors and Cauſes of all Productions and Generations. Theſe Seeds, Spirits or vivifick Salts, are certainly much more exactly elaborated and exalted in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, than Vegetables, and in thoſe which are more perfect than in the leſs; for that there are Inſtruments and Organs purpoſely ordained and contrived by Nature, which are to give a perfection to the Seminalities of Men, and other Creatures, which are endued with a regular ſhape, proportionable to the nobleneſs and exactneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, which they are to deſign and build, when they are employed for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the kind in the act of Generation.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57881:41"/>Brain an animal Liquor for the production of Spirits, which in the Veins and Arteries (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for that cauſe with infinite turnings and windings) is made more ſubtil and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil, and the Parts are in their paſſages ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly mixed; the more groſs and terreſtrial are ſeparated, and at length the refined and exalted Liquor is ſent into the inward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and body of the Stones, where being farther elaborated and mingled with the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salt (the innate ferment of thoſe parts) it becomes Seed.</hi> It is farther to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That when the Ferment implanted in the genital parts, comes to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ripened, and by a long digeſtion has ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to its perfection, Men and Women attain to that ſtate and maturity which we call in Latin <hi>Pubertas.</hi> At that time the genital parts grow hot, and being filled with ſeminal Spirits, diſcharge themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually of ſome part of them, by the veins into the maſs of blood, from whence the nervous Juyce and Spirits become tinctured and impregnated with the ſeminal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo that about that time the blood grows high and luxuriant, and in Women being hardly contained within its own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, is emptied every Month by a periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal turgeſcency. There is at this time a great alteration wrought in the manners
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57881:41"/>and behaviour; and the ranck, acid ſcents, vented by the Emunctories of the Nerves, do declare, That the Juyce which paſſes in them, is inſpired with the geniture. Now if for want of ſeaſonable Evacuation by Coition, this genital ſpirit does not only too much abound in the blood, but alſo, in its frequent Returns by the Arteries to the Teſticles, is overdigeſted, and too highly elaborated (which is called by <hi>Phyſitians</hi> contracting a malignant quality) it renders the ſpirits upon all ſlight occaſions (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Women, whoſe Nerves and Brains are weak) liable to ſudden and impetuous Fermentations; ſo that upon the Orgaſms of theſe unruly Seminalities, and a forcible diſunion of the ſaline part from the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous, thoſe Exploſions and Convulſions are cauſed in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and other parts;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>This Notion I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to Dr.</hi> Willis.</note> which are ſo violent for the moſt part, and impetuous, that they cannot well be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be produced by any other cauſe, than ſuch as muſt at leaſt equal the force of Gunpowder.</p>
                  <p>And we find how apt theſe ſpirits are to take fire in the blood, and nervous juyce, by the cauſes which in Women, liable to the Fits, induce a Paroxyſm. For paſſions of the mind, violent exerciſe, ſweet ſmells or any ſlight cauſe, whereby the blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57881:42"/>are chafed, preſently brings on a Fit: that the abounding of the ſeminal ſpirits in the body, may be one cauſe of the Fits of the Mother (and certainly it is the moſt violent) is confirm'd by the obſervation of <hi>Riolan,</hi> who affirms, <hi>That upon the Diſſection of Hyſterical Virgins, he has found their Teſticles bigger than his Fiſt, filled with ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But certainly, as the Seed is one cauſe of this Diſeaſe, ſo is it oftentimes produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from other cauſes, and oftentimes when the genital parts are not in fault. Nay, it is often obvious to be obſerved, That a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the uterine Ferment, as in Cache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Green-ſickneſs Maids, has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be much afflicted with Hyſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Paſſions. For the blood in ſuch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for want of the ſeminal tincture which ought at a due time to enliven and inſpire it, remains crude &amp; ſlimy, and does not as it ought, cleanſe its ſelf by its menſtrual Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which means many Impurities are caſt upon the Brain, with which the nervous juyce becomes to be much vitiated, and to prove an improper Vehicle for the ſpirits; and by exciting preternatural Fermentations in the nervous parts to cauſe Hyſterical Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxyſms, which happen for the moſt part periodically, and at ſet-times, when the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57881:42"/>body expects its lunary benefits; for at ſuch times the nervous juice, as well as the Blood, being ſaturated with Fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, indeavours by fermentation to depurate it ſelf; by which, the Animal Spirits are put into diſorder, and the nerves drawn into convulſive motions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two, The Seed and Menſtruous blood retained, are the onely cauſes of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical fits, which are aſſigned, by almoſt all Authours, except <hi>Riverius,</hi> who adds, that other humours likewiſe retained in the womb and genital parts have likewiſe their ſhares in producing thoſe Symptoms: which he concludes from obſerving, That many Old-Women, who are neither trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Seed or menſtruous blood, are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very obnoxious to theſe diſtempers. To which, he adds a Notion of his own, which, he ſayes, is of very great moment, and ſeems very agreeable to this Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, That <hi>Hyſterical Paſſions are not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by vapours, raiſed from the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſubſtances. But the very humours, which find no vent by the paſſages of the womb (which is a kind of Sink to the body) through a ſuppreſſion of the Menſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Riv. <hi>pr. l.</hi> 15 <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>or the Whites, are ſent back to the upper parts, and infect them with an ill quality, which they have contracted by too long a stay in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels

                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe Cauſes, which are delivered by Writers, may all ſuch be added as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of this Diſtemper, which are apt, by vellicating the extremities of the nervs, to cauſe Convulſions. Such are ſharp juices in the womb, ſpleen, and other bowels, ſchirrous tumours, not onely in the womb, but in the ſtomach, meſentery breaſt, and other parts. The ſame accidents will wounds in the nerves produce; and in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſubject to Fits; even gentle Vomits which work by cauſing a convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſtomach) will put them into Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical Paroxyſms, as I obſerved lately in a Lady my patient, to whom being above fifty years of age, upon very urgent indications I gave onely <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iii's of infuſion of <hi>Crocus metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi> and becauſe I knew her to be Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtericall, and had formerly obſerved in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Paroxyſmes induced by Vomits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe tooke it, I ordered an Hyſterical plaiſter to her Navel.

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THE Cauſes of the alteration of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes from their ancient ſtate and condition, the Author of <hi>Medela</hi> aſſigns to be the <hi>Pox</hi> and <hi>Scurvey,</hi> which by carnal contact, by ill cures, by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental contagion, by haereditary propagation and by lactation, he ſuppoſes, ſo to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſpread the whole face of Mankind as that by them there is introduced an univerſal alteration and depravation of Nature, from whence he would inferr, that the rules Methods and Medicines, which were uſed by the Ancients, in the curing of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are become altogether uſeleſſe in ours.</p>
               <p>As to carnal contact, haereditary propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and lactation. I very readily grant that the Pox and ſcurvy may by thoſe ways be communicated from the diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the ſound. But as to accidental Contagion, as he calls it) upon which point lies the main ſtreſs of his Arguments for the univerſality of thoſe diſeaſes) by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57881:45"/>which they, like the Plague, infect at a diſtance, and by ſteams &amp; emanations, taint the whole ſtock of Mankind, it is a meer whim of his own, and ſo far from being a ſolid truth, that it is point blank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the daily experiecne of the world and the authority and obſervations of the moſt learned and faithful Writers, and the very Nature and Eſſence of thoſe diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>When <hi>M. N.</hi> comes to handle the point of the propagation of the Pox and Scurvy by ill cures; it is pleaſant to obſerve, that he does not onely fling dirt upon the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſitians, for letting blood and uſing the purgers of the Shops; but (that he may ingroſs all the ſinners of the Town) he likewiſe falls foul upon his own Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, the men of his own Rank and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Phyſick the poor Quacks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks; who pretend to the Cure of the Venereal diſeaſe, and to make room for his own very injuriouſly tears down their bills from the Poſts.</p>
               <p>On my word he will make no ill trade of it, if he can perſwade the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they have the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> and then that nobody but himſelf can cure it. But, paſſing by his immodeſt and uncleanly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as not deſigning to make my ſelf acceptable to Stews, and Brothel-houſes,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57881:46"/>I will fall upon the other more important and leſs offenſive diſquiſition concerning <hi>Phlebotomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to that he tells us he <hi>could</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) <hi>willingly write a Treatiſe,</hi> (and a learned one it would be) <hi>touching the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs done by bleeding in theſe Northern parts of the world in moſt Diſeaſes, as well as Agues and Fevours, becauſe of the mixture of the Scorbut, and his main reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that if it be true (ſince the liver is turn'd out of the Office of Sanguification) Sanguis ſanguificat blood makes blood of the chyle, and doth it</hi> ad modum tincturae. &amp;c. Now I will grant to him that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is very juſtly diſcharged of the office of ſanguification, as I will anon more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, and that in ſome ſenſe the blood may be ſaid to make blood, and yet upon this ſcore is it impoſſible for that great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of bloud letting eſtabliſhed by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Authority of the whole learned worlp in the leaſt to grow out of eſteem.</p>
               <p>Firſt then I will tell hm, what Dr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> ſayes upon this point.

                  <hi>But while I affirme</hi> (ſayes that Oracle) <hi>the ſoul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide firſt and principally in the blood. I would not have any man hastily to conclude from hence, that all blood letting is dangerous or hurtful, or believe, with the vulgar, that as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57881:46"/>much blood, ſo much life is taken away, becauſe Holy Writ placeth the life in the blood.</hi> For daily experience ſhews that letting Blood is a ſafe cure for ſeveral diſeaſes, and the chiefeſt of univerſal remedies; becauſe the default or ſuperfluity of the blood is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of moſt diſtempers; and a ſeaſonable Evacuation of it, doth ofteneſcue men from moſt deſperate maladies and even death it ſelf: for look how much blood is according to Art taken away, ſo many years are added to the age. Nature her ſelf was our tutor here, whom Phyſitians tranſcribe. For ſhe of her own accord doth many times vanquiſh the moſt mortal infirmities by a plentifull and critical evacuation either by the noſe, haemorrhoids, or by menſtruous purgations. And therefore Young-people, who feed high, and live idely, unleſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the eighteenth or twentieth year of their age (at which time the ſtock of Bloud increaſes, together with the Bulk of their bodies) be disburdned of the load and oppreſſion of their blood, either by a ſpontaneous releaſe at the noſe, or inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts, or by breathing a vein, they are dangerouſly ſet upon by <hi>Fevours, Small pox, Head-aches,</hi> and other more grievous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtempers, and Symptoms. Alluding to which, the Farriers do begin almoſt all cures
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57881:47"/>of beaſts with letting blood. This is the opinion of that great Secretary of Nature. Nor is it onely his ſenſe, but the beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do affirm, and <hi>Riverius</hi> for one, that in the diſeaſecalled the <hi>Rheumatiſm</hi> (which ſeldome is without a high tincture of the <hi>Scorbute</hi>) blood muſt be taken away for ten or twelve dayes together,
<note place="margin">Riv. <hi>Prax. Med.</hi> l. 16. c. 3.</note> every day till the pain vaniſhes, and the ſtrength ſeems to fail, which does not by loſs of blood in this diſeaſe. And in this caſe I can appeal to my own experience: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to a perſon of Quality in <hi>August,</hi> 1665. in <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> (in councell with that Judicious, and Learned Phyſitian Dr. <hi>Filding</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter</hi>) who then lay miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably tormented with a <hi>Rheumatiſm,</hi> being free from pain in no part of his Body, not having the uſe of any of his Limbs, though he where a Perſon, who theſe many years has been highly Scorbutical, we drew from him at leaſt the quantity of 70 ℥ of blood, before we could free him from pain, and reſtore him to his health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Platerus</hi> makes mention of a Mad-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<note place="margin">Plat. <hi>Obſ.</hi> l. 1. p. 80.</note> who was cured by being let blood in ſeveral Veins, ſeventy times in one Week. I might run through all other diſeaſes, and ſhew the neceſſity of bleeding, which may happen in moſt of them: but becauſe <hi>M.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57881:47"/>N</hi>'s. main Argument, is founded upon Sanguification, I will endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, how the Chyle is turn'd into Blood, and in what parts of the body chiefly this work is effected: So that by diſcovering the true way of Sanguification, his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may appear to be ill grounded.</p>
               <p>That the Liver is not the Shop, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Blood is made, is evident to any man who will examin the generation of Animals; for,
<note place="margin">Harv. <hi>de Gen. Ex</hi> 18. p. 63. <hi>Ex.</hi> 50. p. 153. <hi>Ex.</hi> 59. <hi>p.</hi> 207.</note> he ſhall perceive the Heart beat, and Blood perfectly coloured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there appear any rudiments of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſo that the Liver is made after the Blood, and, as it were, ſticks upon little ſlender threds; and the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of it, evidently grows out of the mouths of the Arteries, through which matter is ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the formation of it; ſo that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma</hi> of it ſeems to be nothing elſe, but congealed blood. Again, the Chyle never goes to the Liver, but empties it ſelf into the <hi>Subclavial</hi> Veins, and goes ſtreight away to the right Ventricle of the Heart.</p>
               <p>Now, the uſe and buſineſs of the Liver,
<note place="margin">Gliſſon <hi>Anat. Hep.</hi> c. 41.</note> is without doubt, that which is aſſigned by the eminently learned D. <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> that it is made to receive the blood, which runs to it by the <hi>Porta,</hi> to ſeparate the Choler from it,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57881:48"/>and then being freed from that, to deliver it to the <hi>Cava.</hi> The very Make and Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of that Bowel, argues as much: as alſo the diſtribution of the Veſſels to every part of the <hi>Parenchyma:</hi> for the <hi>Porta</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpenſes the blood into all parts of it, and the ſmall <hi>Capillary</hi> threads of the <hi>Porus Biliarius,</hi> are every where diſperſed, and ready to receive the choler, which is brought along mingled with the blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every part. And in like manner, the ſmall branches of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> are every where interwoven and at hand, to carry away the blood, when cleanſed and freed from the bilious part of it. Now the choler is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the blood by a certain kind of Percolation. For, the blood iſſuing out from the <hi>Porta,</hi> into the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or fleſhy parts of the Liver, finds that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance full of pores or little ſpaces of divers ſhapes and figures, and proportionable to the ſhape, ſiſe, and figuration of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> or <hi>Atoms</hi> of blood and choler, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thoſe which are ſuitable to the ſhape of the parts of choler, open into the ſmall pipes of the <hi>Porus biliarius;</hi> thoſe which are anſwerable to the ſhape of the Atoms of blood, convey it into the little mouths of the <hi>Cava.</hi> Theſe pores or little holes eaſily let paſs thoſe parts of mater which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57881:48"/>are correſpondent to their ſhape, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe all of another Figure, as we ſee water will diſſolve common ſalt, and imbibe it ſo long, till all the ſpaces which agree with the ſhape of it, be fill'd, and then will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no more; but yet afterwards will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſugar or ſalts of another Figure, ſo long, till they have fill'd the ſpaces ſuitable to their ſhape.</p>
               <p>The ſeparation of choler in the Liver may not unfitly be explain'd, by that which is made in Sieves, whereof ſome are made only to ſever Chaff and duſt, ſome for Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſome for Barley, others for Oats; which, according to the ſhape of the holes let paſſe or refuſe, this or the other Grain.</p>
               <p>Having thus explain'd the Anatomy of the Liver, I will proceed to diſcourſe of the Nature of Blood it ſelf, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Engine which is employed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it; and to that end, let me trace the paſſage of the Chyle, that we may the better find when and where it is turn'd to blood. It is well known to every man, who has but in any meaſure inquired into Phyſick and Anatomy,
<note place="margin">Willis De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. Nerv.</note> that as ſoon as the meat is diſſolv'd by the <hi>menſtruum</hi> of the ſtomach, it is preſſed down into the guts, and out of them all the way almoſt to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57881:49"/>very <hi>Anus,</hi> the thinner and finer part is forced into the <hi>Lacteals,</hi> out of which it is delivered into the common Channel of the chyle, and being mingled with a whey, which comes out of the <hi>Lymphaticks,</hi> it enters the <hi>Subclavials,</hi> out of which it runs mingled with the blood into the great Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi> Out of which, paſſing into the right Ventricle of the heart, by the motion of that Engin, through the <hi>Pulmonary</hi> Arteries, it is flung into the Lungs; out of which, having there ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſome phlegmatick, or crude excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and being impregnated with the nitre of the air, which is drawn in by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration (and being in the Lungs, as with a Churn, or Chocolate-mill, more exactly mingled with the blood) it haſtens by the <hi>Pulmonary</hi> Vein, to the left Ventricle of the heart, out of which by the <hi>Aorta,</hi> it is ſent to all the parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Chyle may be eaſily traced, and truly, I know not why it may not, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſſed the laſt deflagration in the heart, be juſtly called Blood. I will not in this place bring the diſtinction of the Schools upon the Stage, which diſtinguiſhes that Liquor which runs in the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into Three humours, and Blood, as being now out of doors with all ingenious
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57881:49"/>men, and being no otherwiſe to be applied than as ſome portion of that Liquor has more often, other more ſeldome, or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet at all, paſſed through the heart, and there been fired. But I, in general, term all thoſe juices, Blood, which run in the Veins and Arteries, and have the form, colour, and conſiſtence, of that liquor which is vulgarly called ſo, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts (as certainly all blood does) of parts very <hi>heterogeneous:</hi> and I think the Chyle it ſelf, which comes very white and dilute into the <hi>Subclavials,</hi> when it has undergone the fermentation in the left Ventricle of the heart, may without impropriety be juſtly termed blood. For, though I do acknowledge, that this juice, before it arrive to perfection, does undergo ſeveral fermentations, and ſeparations in divers parts of the body: as, for example, in the Liver, the choler is ſeparated in the Kidneys, the whey in the habit of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeveral excrements are refuſed, which can probably be no other wiſe blown off than by tranſpiration. And though a fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>Spleen, Teſticles, Uterus,</hi> and other parts, be requiſite to give a vigour, life, and height to the blood: yet I take the Heart to be the chief Shop, where it is firſt made, and where it receives
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57881:50"/>it's life, motion, and tincture.</p>
               <p>In the heart (as to our purpoſe) three things are chiefly to be conſidered. 1. The Ventricles or Chambers of it: 2. The Parenchyma or Walls: and 3. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Spirits, (as <hi>Severinus Danus</hi> calls them) which lodge and reſide in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable receſſes of the Parenchyma. Theſe Spirits may be juſtly called the Artificers, or Labourers of blood and life: to theſe we owe all Action, Heat, Motion, Colour, and what not: Theſe, firſt working in the <hi>punctum ſaliens</hi> or <hi>veſicula pulſans,</hi> with a wonderful skill and unexpreſſable art draw the lines &amp; proportions of an animal, ſhape, all the Springs, wheels, pullies, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Engine is neceſſary for life; and after they have drawn the whole Fabrick in the ſmall with an innate prudence, and indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable induſtry, they extend every line to the due Proportion, and build up the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick according to the deſign'd dimenſions, and afterwards are no leſs careful in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body in continual Repair, than they were at firſt in Building of it.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the Ventricles or Chambers of the heart, being incloſed with their Parenchyma, as with ſtrong Walls, do at the very firſt ſight, from their mechanical Structure, ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57881:50"/>to us, to be made for Laboratories for the Blood. <hi>Hogeland</hi> well obſerves,
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That upon the Bloods ruſhing into the Heart, the like boyling and rarefaction is cauſed, as when Spirit of Nitre is poured upon butter of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Des Cartes,</hi> and the beſt Philoſophers and Phyſitians are much of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. This Fermentation ſeems to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Mechanical Spirits, or Seminal Salts; or, if you pleaſe, Ferment of the Heart, which ferments with the active prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Blood and Chyle, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces heat, flame, motion, and a change of colour, the ordinary effects of Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is well known to <hi>Chymiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the act of Generation, the Seed, or reſolv'd Salt being caſt by the Male into the Womb, in the Conception frames the Heart; and by the heat either of incubati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the cheriſhing warmth of the Womb, is excited, and gently falls a fermenting; and at length, boyling more violently, breaks into a flame, which is perpetually kept a foot by a new ſupply of Chyle, the old ſtock of Blood after ſome Deflagrations being left poor and unfit to maintain the Fire. That the Chyle in this Deflagration receives its Tincture, or Scarlet-die, is more than probable.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ent. Apol.</hi> p. 141.</note> The Learned Doctor <hi>Ent,</hi> deduces the variety of Colours from
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57881:51"/>the diverſity of Seminal Salts, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with very good Reaſon: For, ſince Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is nothing elſe, than a certain percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a motion or ſtroak of Light reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Surface of a Body, and ſtriking upon the <hi>tunica retinae</hi> of the Eye; and, that the <hi>Superficies</hi> of every Body is made up of numberleſs Particles of matter, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpoſed among themſelves, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That if upon the Fermentation of Bodies, the ſite and poſition of parts be ſo changed and tranſpoſed, that they return not again to the ſame order wherein they were firſt placed, the <hi>Superficies</hi> muſt be altered, and then the reflection, as alſo the ſtroak of light muſt be different; and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it prove diaphanous, the Body muſt appear of a new colour.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee Water much agitated at Mills, and Chataracts looks white. The blew tincture of Violets having ſome drops of Spirit of Vitriol poured on it, turns Purple; and, immediately by adding ſome few drops of Spirit of Harts-horn, the Purple colour is turn'd into Green. Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57881:51"/>manner, I am very apt to believe; and that the innate Salt or Ferment of the Heart by fermenting with the Chyle, which abounds with volatil Salt and Sulphur, produces this admirable tincture.</p>
               <p>I have obſerv'd, as yet, but two wayes of producing a red colour in Bodies, either by the action of heat upon them, or elſe by the addition of Salts; by heat, white and pale colours are often changed into red, and that eſpecially in Bodies which are not very fluid, and which admit of only a ſlow and leiſurely Fermentation. Thus Quinces by long boyling, contract a Redneſs; Fruit by baking in an Oven, grows Redder, than Raw; and Bricks, by Heat, acquire a red colour. Nay, the Learned Doctor <hi>Gliſſon</hi> affirms, <hi>That in the hot Months of Summer,</hi>

After the ſame manner, the milky juyce of the Chyle is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably turned into Blood; for meeting with the Salt, or Ferment of the Heart, it is turned from white to red, and boils no leſs than the <hi>Chymists</hi> Liquor.</p>
               <p>Having thus endeavoured to explain the manner of Sanguification, and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it chiefly from the firing of the Chyle in the Heart, I do not find, but that upon this Hypotheſis (agreeable to the experience of the World) even in many Scorbutick Affects, Phlebotomy may be moſt neceſſary; but eſpecially (as in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) where the Scorbutick Ferment is (as I may call it) a Stum to the Blood, as I have found it in many, eſpecially in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Berkſhire</hi> above 50 years of Age, who, every Fortnight, or three Weeks, has her Courſes in ſo violent and large a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that except the Flux be by ſeaſonable bleeding often moderated, ſhe is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in danger of bleeding to death.

Now as the Medicins differ in their Natures, ſo, I ſuppoſe, may a different Fermentation be excited in the Blood, and likewiſe a different Excrement or Barm be vented, and wrought off; upon which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the whole buſineſs of elective Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to depend; and, whatever his Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks be, which he ſo much magnifies, they muſt neceſſarily perform their buſineſs by one or other of theſe wayes, except (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Canting) he can demonſtrate a more reaſonable.</p>

And diſcourſing of the reaſon of this Diſeaſe, he makes mention of a relation of the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> concerning a poyſon uſed in <hi>Spain,</hi> made of the juice of White Hellebore, with which the Huntſmen of <hi>Spain</hi> uſe to poyſon their Arrows, and with them kill Deer, and other wild Beaſts. <hi>In the beginning of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>

This poyſon may without harm be taſted by the Tongue, but if the least drop of it be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Blood, it proves moſt pernicious.</hi> And he adds, <hi>That if any one be but pricked with a Needle infected with this juyce, he would dye within a very few hours; and that the Deer wounded with the Arrows dipped in this poyſon, first ſeem to be in a maze, and loſe their ſight, then run round; then fall down, and dye within half an hour at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt. But that which ſeems ſtrange, is, that the fleſh of the Deer thus killed, ſhould be eaten without any kind of harm, and that only the part where the wound was made, was flung away.</hi> He adds farther, <hi>That an Aſs, whoſe back was galled with carrying Burdens, having a Deer laid croſs his back, which was killed with one of theſe Arrows, ſome of the blood from the wound by chance dropping upon the place which was galled, fell down dead before he brought the Deer to the journies end.</hi> He tells us likewiſe, <hi>That the Emperor</hi> Rudolphus

                  <hi>the Second, having ſhot a Deer with one of thoſe Arrows in one of his Horns, which ran away, as though he ayled nothing, did, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſome hours after, as he-came from Hunting, find him dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this, and the like Inſtances, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it may be very reaſonably argued, That from the Doctrine of Atoms, it does not neceſſarily follow, that whatever Venom or Diſeaſe will infect the Blood, by a groſs and corporeal Contact or Attrition, will likewiſe perform the ſame effects at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by ſubtle Effluxes, or Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſmall Bodies or Atoms. For though we ſee in the Plague, and ſome other malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Diſeaſes, that the Venom, like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, quickly pierces the Pores, and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it ſelf into the maſs of Blood, and that often at a conſiderable diſtance from the Body, out of which are ſent thoſe deadly and pernicious ſteams: yet we find this men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Spaniſh poyſon, though of more deadly and quick force to the deſtruction of life, when once mingled with the Blood, does not as much as penetrate the Pores of the Skin (poſſibly, by reaſon of the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Figures of the Atoms) nor, (though taſted by the Tongue, a part ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible of all impreſſions) communicate to the Nerves or Veins any venemous or mortal Ferment.</p>

But after the courſe of many Years, (either the influence above being appeaſed, which bred them ſo horrible, and raging; or by long experience, their proper Remedies and Cures being found out) the Diſeaſe began to be leſs malicious, changing it ſelf into divers kinds of Maladies, differing from the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; whereof truly the Regions and People of our Times might juſtly complain, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto them without their proper diſorder; ſeeing it is well approved by all thoſe that have diligently ſtudied and obſerved the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that Evil, that either never, or

The</hi> French <hi>think it reaſonable to acquit them of the Ignominie, for that it is known ſince, that ſuch a Diſeaſe was tranſported out of</hi> Spain <hi>to</hi> Naples, <hi>and yet not proper or natural to that Nation; but brought thither from the Iſles, which (in thoſe Seaſons) began to be known to our Regions by the Navigation of</hi> Chriſtopher Columbus <hi>a</hi> Genoway; <hi>in which Iſles (by the favour of Nature) are Remedies ready to cure that Ill, by drinking only of the juyce of a wood, (moſt ſingular for many other worthy Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) which gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>By this Account of <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> it is evident, That by the moſt exact Obſervers of that Diſeaſe, both in its birth, increaſe, and ſpreading in <hi>Italy,</hi> 'twas found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that it was either never, or rarely, any other way contracted, than by Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Coition with infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>And indeed, that the venom of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous Diſeaſe, is founded in a dull, heavy, and unactive matter, and not in a Ferment of ſo ſwift a motion, as to infect at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, appears very much from the way of its Cure; for whereas the Plague, which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57881:57"/>ſwiftly infects, is (before it has too much poyſoned and corrupted the Blood and Juyces) by Sudorificks, eaſily expelled at the ends of the Arteries. The Venereous Diſeaſe on the other ſide, is of ſo ſluggiſh parts, that there is no ſeparating of the Morbifick matter from the maſs of Blood, and nervous Liquor, without dreining the Body of almoſt all its Juyces, either by Sweating, or Salivation. I have obſerv'd in the Cure of ſome perſons tainted with this Diſeaſe, That as long as they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd to themſelves the drinking of Beer, though in a ſmall quantity, no great benefit has enſued upon the moſt effectual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but when once they have ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd themſelves to the uſe of appropriate Dyet-drinks, in the courſe of their other Remedies, in the ſpace of three or four dayes, all ill Accidents have vaniſhed. It is not therefore likely, that a Diſeaſe which ſticks ſo ſtubbornly in the Blood and Juyces of the Body, ſhould flie as ſwift, as light, all over the World, and leave not ſo much as a poor Thraſher or Milk-maid free from its Contagion.</p>
               <p>In the next place, The Nature or Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Scurvy, conſiſting in the Bloods being overcharged with fixed or fluid Salts, renders that Diſeaſe very unfit to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57881:57"/>at a diſtance. For whatever Diſeaſe acts upon, or infects a Body at a diſtance, muſt be of active, nimble and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til parts, eaſily flying out of the Pores of one Body, and with the like facility inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into the mouths of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Bodie's veins; and of ſo ſwift motion, that the Contagious Corpuſcles, when they are rambling in the Atmoſphere, ſhall receive little or no alteration, either in their motions, from the occurſion of other Bodies; or in their Figure, from the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or beating of other Particles of matter which they meet in their way (for upon theſe affections of matter, all virtues and operations of one Body upon another do depend.)</p>
               <p>Now the eſſence of the Scurvy being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in a fixation of the Salts of the Blood, it ſeems very improbable, That ſuch fix'd Bodies, which cannot by the force of fire be carried up to the top of an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, ſhould be proper Meſſengers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Infection at a diſtance. Beſides, Saline Particles being too groſs to be put into thoſe violent motions which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in infectious Ferments, though they may by Sweat, or inſenſible Tranſpiration, iſſue out of the diſeaſed Body; yet if they Travel far in the Air, they will either in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57881:58"/>their way combine with other Particles of matter, and ſo loſe their Properties (as we ſee the Salts of a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Powder of Coral, and other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaceous Bodies) or elſe in their Journey by the meeting and juſtling with other Atoms, have their motions and figures ſo altered, that they would wholly loſe their former operations and virtues.</p>
               <p>Now from the Inſtances which I have given of ſundry poyſonous Bodies, which, (though they muſt be allowed to be of a very active venom, and conſtantly to ſend forth ſtreams, or <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Atoms) do, notwithſtanding, never poyſon at a diſtance. And of ſome which infect not by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Contact with the Skin, and never but where they are mingled with the Blood; from the Accompt which <hi>Guicciardin</hi> gives of the Obſervations which the World made of the <hi>French Pox,</hi> in its Original and Growth; And from the Arguments drawn from the Cure of that Diſeaſe: As alſo from the Nature and Formality of the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, it very clearly appears, That <hi>Fernelius</hi> and <hi>Sennertus</hi> are in the right, when (though they allow the Pox and Scurvy to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Diſeaſes) they deny them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (like the Plague) at a diſtance.

               <p>As to his Quotation out of <hi>Sennertus,</hi> it makes nothing for him: that Author in that place, ſaying no more than what every Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian agrees with him in; to wit, <hi>That Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers complicated with the Pox, are more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly cur'd, than Simple ones;</hi> which is no more then what holds true as to all other Diſeaſes, where there is a Complication, though the Pox do not make one. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly many Diſeaſes in one Body are not ſo eaſily encountered as one, and oftentimes the Indications contradicting one the other, the ſame Methods and Medicins which are proper for the quelling and extinguiſhing one of the Diſtempers, do at the ſame time ſtrengthen and increaſe the other.</p>
               <p>The Authority of his Friend <hi>Helmont,</hi> (who affirms, <hi>That from a Complication of the Peſtilence with the French Ferment, the Plague is now more frequent than in former Ages; that it ſeizeth us upon the leaſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cruelly purſueth, and more eaſily ſpreads it ſelf, becauſe of its being aſſociated with this new venom or poyſon)</hi> does not much weigh
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57881:60"/>with me in this Point, as to which I can oppoſe Hiſtory and Experience againſt him. For I do not find, but that the Records of former Ages, deliver Deſcriptions of as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, dreadful, and depopulating Plagues, as any have hapned in our times. Let him conſult <hi>Kircher, De Peſte</hi> (his admir'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) and he will find at the latter end of his Book, a long Catalogue of Plagues which infeſted the World before ever the French Diſeaſe came out of <hi>America;</hi> and that they then, as now they uſually afflicted Armies, and Camps, in which malignant E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical Diſeaſes are uſually bred; not by any pocky Ferment, but by the Neceſſities, ill Dyet, and Naſtineſs, which uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the number, and motions of thoſe vaſt Bodies.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, After the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> upon the occaſion of that War, there ſprang up a Plague which over-ran all <hi>Greece.</hi> That there was a great Plague which deſtroyed <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Army, when he rais'd it to fall into <hi>Greece,</hi> appears out of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and by the Letters ſent from the Governor of the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> to <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> The Plague of <hi>Athens</hi> (which, as deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Lucretius,</hi> ſeems to have been a more diſmal Peſtilence, than has ever hapned ſince to any one People) is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57881:60"/>ſaid to have ariſen upon the War between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Again, <hi>Livy</hi> deſcribes a horrible Plague which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the <hi>Roman</hi> Army when <hi>Marcellus</hi> beſieged <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> And it is Recorded, that <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> 252. there was ſo univerſal a Peſtilence, that no Province in the World was free from the ſame. Theſe Inſtances ſufficiently conſute <hi>Helmont,</hi> whom I will diſmiſs with Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Cenſure of him in his Preface introductory to his Sceptical Chymiſt; of whoſe Ratiocinations (ſayes that Learned Gentleman) not only ſome ſeem very extravagant, but even the reſt are not wont to be as conſiderable as his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.</p>

                  <hi>That the French Spirit, called</hi> Lues Venerea, <hi>haunts not only the inward parts of Men, but the outward alſo; appearing in the form of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, hard Bumps in the Fleſh, inflamed Tumors, purulent Apoſtemes; as alſo renders Wounds hard to be cur'd, inſomuch, that the beſt Chirurgions do complain, with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That of late, even the ſlighter Wounds will hardly yield to the uſual Remedies, ſo that there is need of a new foundation for Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, as well as Phyſick.</hi> And the better to prove this, he acquaints us, <hi>That in the Year</hi> 1661. <hi>he himſelf had a hot fiery Impetigo,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57881:61"/>which ran through his Beard round like a Red Half-Moon, from one Ear to the other; and after all manner of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguents, Waters, Lot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe is this Story of the Beard and Ears, ſince it proves nothing, but that the French Malady was got very near his Noſe, and that his Ears (which he has ſo often forfeited) are ſtill upon his Head?</p>
               <p>I know well, that Bodies infected with the French Diſeaſe, do uſually break out in Bumps, Ulcers, Sores and Apoſtemes, which do not yield to ordinary Remedies, and only to ſuch as do ſpecifically reſpect the poyſon of that Diſtemper. But the queſtion in Diſpute, is, Whether all ſound Bodies which never have contracted any Venereal venom by groſs and corporeal Contact, are notwithſtanding ſo infected by the wandring Steams or Atoms of the Pox, that as much as a Cut-finger, or Broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, cannot now adayes be cured, without the aſſiſtance of Antivenereal Remedies; and, as to this Point, <hi>M. N.</hi> has not in the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57881:61"/>leaſt prov'd it, or, by his Beard, ſhew'd himſelf to be a Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Scurvy, which I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant may be often complicated with other Diſeaſes; and indeed it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that moſt Fevers which invade En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Bodies towards the declination, when the deflagration of the Blood is over, and the Maſs is left impoveriſhed of its Spirit, and richer part, do leave the Blood in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a neceſſary tendency and diſpoſition to the Scurvy: And therefore judicious Phyſitians very uſually, after the <hi>Criſis</hi> is over, have recourſe to Antiſcorbutical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, as the Salts of Plants, the acid Spirits of Minerals, Preparations of Steel, Juices and Extracts of Vegetables, and the like; by which, the languiſhing Ferments of the Bowels are reviv'd, and the Spirits of the Blood quickned, and reſtored; and the mixture of the Chyle with the old ſtock of Blood, the better and more orderly performed. But to make the Pocky and Scorbutick Ferment in all Diſeaſes, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a Refuge and Sanctuary for Ignorance, as the Devil, and Occult qualities, among the vulgar renderers of cauſes, is very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Philoſopher, and will at length ſo much debauch that moſt ſignificant term of Ferment, that it will bring it into diſcredit
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57881:62"/>with enquiring men, who cannot permit themſelves to be ſatisfied with words, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſomething be repreſented by them. For in good earneſt, I do not ſee how <hi>M.

For there is not one queſtion you can ask him in Phyſick concerning the cauſe of any Diſeaſe or Symptom, but he is preſently ready to anſwer, That it flows from a Combination with a Pocky and Scorbutick Ferment; A very compendious way indeed, of being a Philoſopher; but no whit more ſatisfactory in Phyſick, than, <hi>Bellarmine, Thou lyeſt;</hi> in anſwering all the difficulties and objections in Divinity.</p>

               <p>THe Third Point from whence <hi>M.N.</hi> inferrs, That all Diſeaſes are altered from their ancient ſtate and condition, is (forſooth) Vermination, or breeding of Worms; and he pretends, <hi>That in theſe dayes they are more frequently appearing in all manner of Fevers, and other Diſeaſes, than in former time;</hi> and his Reaſon is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the intermixture of the Pocky and Scorbutick Ferments, Humors are more vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and a more poyſonous, putredinous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or corruption is introduced into mens Bodies, than was wont to be in elder time.</hi> But that this is no new thing, that it is not more frequent in Diſeaſes than formerly, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens upon any ſcore of the Pox or Scurvy, the Authority of the Ancients, the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the reaſon of the production of thoſe Animals, and the obſervation of their Generation throughout all the Families of Nature, will evidently diſcover.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, as to the Authority of the Ancients, <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and other Writers, do not only treat of three ſorts of Worms which are uſually generated in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57881:63"/>the Guts, but they have likewiſe ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Worms, which in theſe days rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have occurr'd to obſervation. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> treats of Worms being generated in Children whil'ſt they are in the Womb, which is ſeldom taken notice of by Modern Writers.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57881:63"/>encompaſſed it, he diſcovered to be a long Red Worm with many Feet: After this, he Coughed up another of the ſame kind, and then grew very well, and has ſince continued free from his Cough.</hi>

               <p>There was a Diſeaſe of Worms amongſt the Ancients (though in their Times and Countries, the Scurvy and Pox were not ſtirring) which is ſeldom to be met with in our Age; it was called by the <hi>Grecians, Drancucula,</hi> and by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Vena Civilis,</hi> or <hi>Medena.</hi> I have met only with two Modern Authors who treat of it.

Neque ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne video</hi> (ſayes that learned Author) <hi>cur magis in animalibus lapides, quam in lapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus animalia naſci queant: atque ut nobis metallicos ſpiritus ſacile tribuo, ita illis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males concedere (ſalvâ virtutis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And indeed no wonder, ſince <hi>animarum plena ſunt omnia,</hi> ſince the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is full of life and ſoul, if in all bodies whatſoever, which undergo either a quick or ſlow fermentation, Worms, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, r Animals be continually produced. But in humane bodies, whoſe Juices and Blood are ſubject to diſorderly and morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick fermentations, upon diſſolution of the <hi>Craſis,</hi> and Temperature of thoſe Liquors,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57881:67"/>a generation of Infects muſt of neceſſity frequently enſue. For although whilſt a man is in health, and a due temperament of the vital, animal, and natural Conſtitutions is maintain'd, by the power of the Spirits all heterogeneous Seeds are either kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſuppreſt; or elſe, as offenſive gueſts, preſently exterminated out of the Body; when once by Diſeaſes the Spirits are aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the right tone and temper of the parts, and mixture of the Juices is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, thoſe extraneous Ferments which were before kept in ſubjection, rebell; and (being as it were at their own diſpoſe, and uncontrolled) effect thoſe generations which are moſt ſutable to the nature of their Seminalities.</p>
               <p>From this cauſe it proceeds, That often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times putrid and malignant Fevers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Worms, which are more commonly the Effects, than Cauſes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oſe Diſtempers; and are not produced by any intermixture of a Pocky and Scorbutick Ferment; but from the Salts or Seminali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe Infects, which in the diſorder and confuſion of the Body in Fevers, are ſet at liberty. For thoſe ſubtil and active parts of matter getting looſe (during the inteſtine motion, or hurly burly of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Blood and Liquors) from
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57881:67"/>other Concretions to which they were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, immediately ſeize upon ſome or other of the more groſs parts, then form Organs for motion, and preſently become Animals. From this Reaſon it is, That Children at the time of breeding their Teeth (which puts them into a feveriſh Diſtemper) are moſt commonly troubled with Worms, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerves in his Aphoriſms, who ſpeaking of the time of Childrens breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teeth, and the Diſeaſes which they are then ſubject to, ſayes thus, <hi>Ipſis vero gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuſculis, tonſillarum inflammationes,</hi>

               <p>Here we ſee this learned Philoſopher and Phyſitian, does not aſcribe the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Worms, to the Pocky and Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Ferments; but to Salts, from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of which it often comes to paſs, that not only common Worms, but Inſects of different <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and even Serpents have been produced in almoſt every part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies; and though one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Bladder of Gall, by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the Juice which it contains, which is very forcible to deſtroy Worms; and the Spleen, by the ſharpneſs of its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, ſhould be exempted from being liable to produce thoſe Creatures: yet even in theſe parts, great numbers of Worms have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57881:69"/>been found. <hi>Muffet</hi> tells us of a Diſeaſe, which at one time was very frequent in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> which the <hi>Polonians</hi> called <hi>Stowny Roback,</hi> and the <hi>Germans Hauptwurm;</hi> it ſeized them with a violent <hi>Hemicrania,</hi> inſomuch, that they fell into a madneſs or phrenſie; and when they were dead upon Diſſection of the Brain, they found a Worm in it. The Phyſitians cured this Diſeaſe with Garlick in Spirit of Wine, which certainly cured all who took it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but the reſt inevitably periſhed. The ſame Author tells us, of a Student in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who vented a Worm by Urine, which had a great many Feet; and that <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> obſerv'd a great many Inſects in the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of the Urine of a perſon labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Apoſtem of the Kidneys. He tells us likewiſe, that at <hi>Francfort</hi> he ſaw Worms like <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> come out of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans womb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1663. I was called to a Family, in which, one after another, ſix or ſeven perſons fell ſick of a malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; it was of a dull, ſluggiſh motion, and continued upon them whom it ſeized a Month, or Five weeks, before they recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. One remarkable Accident which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied it, was a continual Cough; by which the perſons affected did continually
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57881:70"/>both day and night, bring up an incredible quantity of ill-coloured and very bad ſcented phlegm, of which the Nurſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bringing me one day a Porringer full, ſhew'd me in it a twiſt as it were of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hairs, each, at leaſt, half as long as my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; we obſerved every one of them to be animated, and endued with a brisk and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion. It will not ſeem ſtrange to any man, that theſe rare Productions of ſundry <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Worms ſhould happen in mens Bodies, if we conſider, That in our Meats, Drinks, and Air, the Salts or Seminalities of ſundry Inſects may be conveyed into, and mingled with our Blood, which are kept under by the dominion of the Spirits, and never are permitted to exerciſe their own natural Operations, till in Diſeaſes, and Diſorders of the Body, they come to be ſet at liberty. Now the cauſes and reaſons of the generation of Inſects, as well in humane, as other Bodies, being as ancient as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf (in which the Seeds of Worms, as well as Vegetables, received their power of multiplying) there appears no reaſon why Worms ſhould in theſe times be more frequently appearing in Fevers, and other Diſeaſes, than in former; or that any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould by vermination be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of Diſeaſes.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:57881:70"/>
               <p>Now, as to the Experiments of <hi>Kircher,</hi> though I will not queſtion the faith of that Author in delivering them, yet I do not doubt, but in former Ages, by the help of a good <hi>Microſcope,</hi> the ſame Obſervations might have been made.</p>
               <p>And though I will allow, that in times of Peſtilence, by the indiſpoſition of the Air, and the rambling of pernicious ſteams flowing from infected Bodies, more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſwarms and numerous productions of inſects in the Air and other Bodies, may inſue than in other more healthful ſeaſons; yet I muſt beg leave of <hi>Kircher</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſome difficulties in aſſenting to his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> ſince the manner of infection from the plague, may be more eaſily made out from the figure and motion of Atoms, than by thoſe ſwarms of living creatures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually vented from the infected Body, which, if they poiſon the ſound Body, by turning its Blood and Juices into the like pernicious Vermin, I ſee no reaſon, why they ſhould not fill the whole Air with their fatal progeny, and impregnating the Winds with their Venemous Colonies, permit no man to be ſafe, though removed at a conſiderable diſtance from the places which are infected: Whereas, it is found true by conſtant Experience, (except by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57881:71"/>ſome common cauſe, which has corrupted the whole aire, the plague be produced) The peſtilence inſects not at a far diſtance, but only within a narrow Sphere. It is very poſſible, that not only the Blood of men in <hi>Feavers,</hi> but alſo that of healthy perſons, may ſometimes be obſerv'd to be full of Mites or Worms, as well as Milk and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and yet no malignant Diſtemper, much leſſe the plague be produc'd by them. For we find, that theſe Liquors, though almoſt conſtituted of innumerable little Animals, are not in the leaſt adverſe to the nature of man: and, on the contrary, the beſt and ſharpeſt Vinegar (which moſt abounds with Worms) to be an excellent Antidote and preſervative againſt the plague.

               <p>As to the Cure of malignant <hi>Feavers,</hi> though I know well that in them Worms
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57881:71"/>are often produced in the Bowels and other parts, from the putrifaction of the Aliment, and corruption of the Ferments of the parts, yet they are not ſeldome free from thoſe accidents; and when they happen, Nature and Phyſicians have ſo ordered the matter, that generally moſt Medicines, which are <hi>Alexipharmical</hi> are likewiſe proper againſt the Worms. <hi>Riverius,</hi>

               <p>I Have in the foregoing Chapters prov'd at large, that the <hi>Scurvy</hi> was a Diſeaſe, antiently <hi>Endemial</hi> to the Northern parts of the World: I have allowed a notable diſparity to be between the Blood of the Inhabitants of the Regions, ſubject to this Diſeaſe, and that of thoſe Perſons, who breathed the Air where the Ancients liv'd, and made their Obſervations upon Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: Yet is not the difference ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but that a rational Phyſician, may make admirable uſe of much of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Medicines, in the curing of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in theſe Climates, and, even in ſuch caſes, where the <hi>Scurvy</hi> bears a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhare in the complication. And, as to <hi>Vermination,</hi> I have demonſtrated, that Worms are more often the Effects than Cauſes of Diſeaſes; that their productions in humane, and other natural Bodies, was no leſs frequent and obſervable in former times, than ours; and that from them, ſo great a change in all Diſeaſes, as to make void all the Practiſe and Medicines of the

               <p>For many Maxims in Medicine, are founded upon the long and conſtant Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Experience of the World, and ſo adapted to the very Nature and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Man, that in all places and times, they muſt of neceſſity be of admirable uſe. For indeed, many Rules of this Art, are not grounded upon any <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> contriv'd by mans brain, but are themſelves the very foundations, which will (though poſſibly <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have raiſed upon them an ill contrived, and incommodious Structure) remain, (when the Superſtructure is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed) ſtable and unſhaken. And, though it muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiology</hi> and <hi>Pathology</hi> of the Ancients, are very inſufficient to ſatisfie an inquiring man concerning the true cauſes of Diſeaſes and their Symptoms, yet much of the Method certainly is not grounded upon them, but was long in uſe before thoſe notions of Cauſes were invented.</p>
               <p>The learned Dr.
<note place="margin">Willis de Feb.</note> 
                  <hi>Willis</hi> ſpeaks much to this purpoſe, in his Preface before his Book <hi>de Febribus.</hi> He tells us, <hi>that in the cure of Feavers, ſome indications anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently received, do in this age ſtand firm, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57881:75"/>ought to be obſerved to the worlds end; and that they are not founded upon the precepts of Schools, but upon Experience, the Mistreſs and Teacher of the Art of</hi> Phyſick. <hi>And that, though the</hi> Hypotheſes <hi>of the Ancients were erroneous, that did not hinder the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of</hi> Phyſick, <hi>which was first eſtabliſhed by induction from Obſervations, from going on ſucceſſefully: And thence he concludes, that much leſs ſhall a</hi> Theory <hi>built upon true grounds be pernicious to the ſick, or cauſe practitioners to leave that track, which Time and Experience has recommended to them as ſafe. And it cannot be denied, continues he, that bare Empericiſm, without the aſſiſtance of Method and Reaſon, does ſignifie very little; nay, that it does moſt commonly do a world of miſchief, conſidering, that the very ſame Diſeaſes, are not at all times and in all places to be encountred with the ſame Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but he that has ſo joyned both together, that Reaſon ſhall not give Laws to Nature and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, nor theſe corrupt Reaſon, ſeems to be a moſt abſolute and compleat Phyſician.</hi> Now, if it be true (as this excellent Philoſopher and Phyſitian affirms) that much of the method, and many of the precepts of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick do, and will alwayes continue firm and uſeful, becauſe they are not eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on phantaſtical Notion's (ſuch as are the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57881:75"/>Author's of <hi>Medela</hi>) but upon unerring Experience: no leſſe will thoſe Medicines, which the conſtant trial of the World has recommended as effectual, remain ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Phyſitians, before ſuch as are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by the touchy head of <hi>M. N.</hi> or any other whimſical Inventer of Secrets and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. For I have already prov'd at large in the firſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> that the <hi>Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica</hi> is wholly founded upon Experience. That Medicines were at the firſt found out <hi>Crebro ſingularium tentamine,</hi> by a frequent Triall of each Medicine upon ſundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I have there ſhew'd how dangerous it is for ignorant Quacks, to Experiment Medicines (eſpecially ſuch as are hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) upon the Bodies of men.</p>
               <p>I am, for my part, of the ſame opinion with <hi>Varandaeus,</hi> who told the ingenious and learned Doctor <hi>Primroſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Primr. Popular. Err.</hi> l. 1. c. 12.</note> that <hi>thoſe Remedies are the best which are no Secrets, but beſt known, as being confirmed by more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Experience. I confeſſe</hi> (ſayes that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>Phyſitian) that all the virtues of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are not yet perfectly known; as yet many lie hid. If therefore any man hath found out by Experience, the virtue of ſome ſimple Medicament not yet known, that increaſe of Art is to be commended, and deſerves to be called a Secret; as he that firſt found out the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57881:76"/>Vomiting virtue of</hi> Antimony; <hi>He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the compounding, and found out the efficacy of Gun-powder; he that firſt brought</hi> Jalap <hi>into uſe, had Secrets greatly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: ſuch as theſe if any man have, he is worthy of commendation, and I think, no other ſecrets are to be admitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I think it is very evident, that theſe Diſcoveries are not the products of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but Chance, and upon this ſcore man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is poſſibly more indebted to Nature, for diſcreetly concealing the way of making gold than if ſhe had made it as common and eaſy to the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> as ſhe has the Art of making Cheeſe and Butter to the Countrey Houſewives, for in the proſecution of that, ſhe has caſually intiched the world with many accidental Experiments, both in Philoſophy and Phyſick, much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and beneficial to men, than if ſhe had taught us, like <hi>Midas,</hi> to turn all things which we touched into Gold. If I miſtake not, Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi> does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tell us, <hi>that he never diſſected a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his life for the examination of ſome part, or tracing ſome Veſſel which he propos'd to himſelf, but in the operation, ſome new thing was unexpectedly offered to him, which was uſually more conſiderable than the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he deſigned.</hi> I am apt to believe,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57881:76"/>that we are not only in a great meaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Chance and Experience, for the Knowledge of the Virtues of Simples, but that even in Compound Medicines, there have often virtues and qualities reſulted from the Mixture, which were never fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen nor deſigned by the Artiſt who put the ingredients together, but diſcovered by Experience.</p>
               <p>We ſee, that as to thoſe very ancient Medicines, <hi>Mithridate, Treacle,</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcordium,</hi> which are Compounds eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſacred for their Virtues, as well by the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> as <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> it is much more eaſy to prove the truth of their efficacy, than to give the true reaſon of their Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>I would fain know of <hi>M. N.</hi> how he could have been certain that <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum</hi> ſhould not Vomit, or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Dulcis</hi> not have retained in it the corroſive faculty of Sublimate, had not Experience cleared their innocencies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he promiſe, that the action of fire, or a Menſtruum upon thoſe Bodies ſhall not produce Concretes out of <hi>Antimony</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> as highly venemous as theſe mentioned preparations are ſafe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign. We ſee that <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which by all ſorts of men is indifferently taken, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57881:77"/>almoſt any ſenſible miſchief, affords a Spirit one of the moſt ſudden and potent poiſons in the world; which, poſſibly, was at firſt diſcovered at the expence of a mans life, by ſome bold and venturous <hi>Chymiſt.</hi> It is Experience, and not Reaſon, that has taught the <hi>Weſt-Indians</hi> that they may ſafely make their Bread of the Root of <hi>Caſave,</hi>

               <p>Therefore, though <hi>M.

And for his part (if he be not fouly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the opinion of the World) I think there is no leſſe danger in truſting to his Integrity than Skill.

                  <hi>the four firſt Qualities, amongst morbifick Cauſes:</hi> Yet I cannot but aſſent to the learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> who tells us, <hi>That the</hi> Chymiſts <hi>do ill, wholly to reject the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57881:78"/>from being Cauſes of Diſeaſes.</hi> For we find by experience, that as ſoon as a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Diſtemper, either hot, cold, moiſt, or day, is induced upon any part; the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the part is preſently hindered neither is it able to perform its duty and office, till the natural temper be reſtor'd; which is commonly known to happen every day to the ſtomack: And he quotes <hi>Galen,</hi> for inſtancing, <hi>That ſome by ſitting too long upon a cold ſtone, or by ſtaying too long in cold water, have had the Muſcle of the</hi> Anus <hi>reſolv'd:</hi> And he makes mention of another, <hi>Who in a cöld and moist ſeaſon, by wearing too long his wet Coat, fell into a Palſie of his hand, the Nerves which come from the ſpinal marrow to the hand, being thereby too much cool'd and moiſtned:</hi> No body is ignorant, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial it is to a man to drink largely of cold water when he is hot. And ſince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the Cure indicates the Diſeaſe, the ſame mentioned Author bids conſult <hi>Galen,</hi> what great things may be done by Baths of water in Hectick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. And he farther adds, that the advice of <hi>Scaliger</hi> to <hi>Cardan,</hi> may very well be made uſe of to them who reſiſt both Senſe and Experience, who upon <hi>Cardan</hi>'s aſſerting, That Cold was only a Privation; to convince him, advis'd him, to leave off
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57881:79"/>his Cloaths, and go Bare-leg'd, and Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the extremity of Winter. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers do often, to their Coſt, find of what force Cold is, when they loſe their Noſes, Ears, Feet, and Hands, mortified by the violence of its congealing power. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, every days Experience informs us, what changes and alterations are made upon our Bodies, as to Epidemical diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by the hot, cold, moiſt, or dry Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Seaſons and Years. And I cannot but wonder, that the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> ſhould exclude the four firſt Qualities from having any cauſality in diſeaſes; when in their own operations they obſerve a notable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity between the effects of a dry, and moiſt heat: and they employ heat, as the common inſtrument of almoſt all their operations. But whil'ſt I aſſert the Eſſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the firſt qualities, in the cauſing of diſeaſes in the humane Body; I would not be underſtood, to mean by the word Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Being or Entity diſtinct from matter or Body: But that I apprehend by hot, cold, moiſt, and dry, the parts of matter, or Atoms ſo figured, and moved, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Effects which we call heating, cooling, moiſtning, and drying. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, We uſe to have an apprehenſion or notion of heat, from the relation it has to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57881:79"/>the ſenſe, or as it is the efficient cauſe of that acute paſſion, or ſenſation, which we feel in our skin, or any other organ of touch, whil'ſt we are burnt or heated. But this being too particular an effect of heat, only as it works upon an Animal; we ought therefore to conſider it from its more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and comprehenſive effects, upon which this which is more ſpecial does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; which is to enter into the Pores of a Body, to penetrate through the parts of it; and to force, or rend them aſunder from one another, and ſo to diſſolve the union and continuity of the Body. This cannot be underſtood to be done by a bare naked quality, but by certain Atoms which are endued with ſuch a motion, figure, and fize, as are fit to penetrate, diſcuſs, diſſolve, and perform all thoſe effects which we uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attribute to heat. On the other ſide, ſince we find cold the moſt oppoſite thing in the World to heat, if it be the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heat to diſſolve, diſcuſs, and tear aſunder, it is then the property of cold to congeal, faſten, and cloſe together; and thoſe Atoms, which by their ſhape and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures are fit and proper for thoſe effects, may, with very good Reaſon, be called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of cold; and Bodies made up of ſuch Particles, cold Bodies. Thus the Air (which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57881:80"/>is the common Receptacle of heat and cold) upon the blowing of North-winds, is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally filled with ſuch Atoms, as bind, and congeal the Earth, and Water; and in the body of man, both by mingling with the blood, and cloſing the pores, or breathing holes of his body, oftentimes produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſorders. As for humidity, or moiſtneſs, it ſeems to be nothing elſe but a kind of fluidneſs; and Liquors are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid to be moiſt, inaſmuch as when they are poured upon hard and compact bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſome ſmall parts of them are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, either ſticking in the little Cavities of the Surface, and then the body is ſaid to be wet; or elſe have inſinuated themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt inward pores and receſſes of the hard body, which then we commonly ſay is moiſtned. And, on the contrary, drineſs is nothing elſe but a kind of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inaſmuch as a dry body is upon that ſcore the more firm for being void of all moiſture.</p>
               <p>And now I cannot ſee why theſe four firſt Qualities (as they are term'd) ſhould be excluded from having a ſhare in the number of the cauſes of Diſeaſes, ſince they are notably active (eſpecially the three firſt) modifications of matter; and not only apt to excite various motions, and cauſe, as well
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57881:80"/>new Combinations, as diſſolutions of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the great World; but alſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to alter the Microcoſm, and produce fundry different Symptoms, in relation to the motions and harmony of the humane Engin.</p>
               <p>In the next place, though it be utterly untrue, that there are in the Veſſels four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct humors; but whatſoever is contained in the Arteries and Veins, is either the ſtale deflagrated blood, or the alimentary juice freſh come into the Veſſels; or elſe the <hi>Serum</hi> or Whey returned by the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or elſe ſome Particles of Nitre, and other bodies received in by the Lungs and Mouths of the veins from the Ambient. And though the blood differ in ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only as to the abundance, or defect of natural heat; yet are men not improperly ſaid to be of a melancholick, cholerick, or ſome other temperament; inaſmuch, as by how much the more vigorous or remiſs the natural heat is in their bowels and entrals, by ſo much the more weakly or powerfully concoctions are perform'd, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the blood apt to be overcharged either with ſtale, and aduſt, or elſe crude, and phlegmatick Excrements: In which reſpect, the perſon either way diſpoſed, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſaid to be of a phlegmatick, or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57881:81"/>cholerick temper; and if the aduſt, or raw Excrements, be not rightly and duly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated out of the maſs, by the effervenſcy of the blood, I ſee no reaſon why I may not ſay, that a man abounds with a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, cholerick, or phlegmatick humor; and if ſo, the Notions about Pharmacy, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at an evacuation, or elſe alteration of theſe humors, are not framed amiſs, nor (whatever <hi>M. N.</hi> argues to the contrary) without very good reaſon. For, I ſuppoſe, it alters not much the caſe as to practice, whether a man ſuppoſe that there is too great a redundancy of one of the humors in the blood, or whether (which is the right Notion) he apprehend the blood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, either with phlegmatick and raw juyces, or the bilious Excrement conſiſting of Salt and Sulphur, or the melancholick, in which the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> or earthy part, is moſt predominant. For either of theſe Notions will direct us (when the blood is unable to fine its ſelf) to aſſiſt it with thoſe alteratives which time and experience has recommended to us as proper in thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and thoſe Purgers which have been long obſerved more particularly to make a ſeparation, either of the pituitous, chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, or melancholick parts of the blood. For, though it be irrational to think, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57881:81"/>Purgers do with a certain knowledge, or choice, lay hold of one humor rather than another; yet is that diſtinction of Purgers into <hi>Chologoga, Phlegmagoga, Melanagoga,</hi> and <hi>Hydragoga,</hi> of very good uſe, and founded upon obſervation and experience; inaſmuch as theſe ſeveral Purgers by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing very different Fermentations, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly agitating the Particles of the Blood, may, with very good reaſon, cauſe different ſeparations; and ſo one Purger to evacuate that ſort of Excrement, Barm or Lee, which another cannot.</p>
               <p>And in this matter I do not find, that the Improvements which have been made in the Theory of Phyſick, have much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Practice; for the indication for Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not founded upon the Notion of the four Humors, but upon long obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that when Diſtempers diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſuch and ſuch ſigns, the body was to be emptied, and, by frequent tryals, one Purger (as eſpecially <hi>Hellebor</hi> in Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly) was found more eſſectual than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The ſame may be ſaid of altering Medicins; for Example, to inſtance in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paticks, as Cichory, Gentian, Wormwood, Century, Steel, Agrimony, and the like; which are with admirable ſucceſs uſed in Cachexies, Dropſies, and other Diſeaſes,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57881:82"/>cauſed from imperfect Sanguification, though it be now agreed upon by general conſent (upon the Diſſection of Hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, that part being often found lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concern'd) that the Liver has primarily little or nothing to do in thoſe Diſtempers, and is only ſecondarily affected, as being, (as I have ſhewn) very juſtly excluded from the office of Sanguification. And yet we ſee, that Hepaticks are ſtill uſed in the ſame Diſtempers by the beſt, both <hi>Chymiſts</hi> and <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> though the ancient <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> be flung out of doors.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>M. N</hi>'s denying the Spleen to be the Receptacle of Melancholy, and aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it this uſe, <hi>That it is an Elaborator of the nobleſt juyce,</hi> viz. <hi>the arterial blood, by reaſon of that grand intertexture of Arteries, by which it holds a near communication with the vital parts of the body;</hi> for which, he quotes <hi>Bartholinus, Walaeus,</hi> and <hi>Highmore:</hi> I dare aſſure him, he does thoſe worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors great injury; and that neither in them, nor any good Author, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Circulation of the blood, he ever met with any ſuch opinion, That the Spleen, by the Arteries, can hold a near communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the vital parts of the body; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do thoſe Authors which he quotes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Spleen to be the Receptacle of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.

                  <head>A Digreſſion concerning the uſe of the Spleen, and Hypochondriacal distempers.</head>
                  <p>FOr the better underſtanding of the uſe and office of the Spleen, it is requiſite to examine the ſhape, make, and mechanical contrivance of it, that (as by taking a Watch aſunder, we are inform'd for what end and purpoſe every Spring, Pin, and Wheel was made) we may the more certainly diſcover what the deſign of Nature was in framing that Bowel; by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Arteries, Veins and Nerves which conſtitute it; and conſidering the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, colour, ſite, figure, and other appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which offer themſelves to our view. And firſt, as to the bigneſs of it, that is very different according to the variety of mens bodies. They, generally, who have large Veins, have likewiſe great Spleens. The leſſer (except it be much too ſmall) is far better than the bigger. The figure of it is moſt commonly oblong. The colour in <hi>Embrios,</hi> and young Children, red; in thoſe who are more mature and adult, inclinable to a blackneſs. The ſubſtance of it conſiſts
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57881:85"/>of black, groſs blood congealed amongſt the Fibers. It is furniſhed with three ſorts of Veſſels: Firſt, It receives a large branch from the <hi>Caeliac</hi> Arterie which diſperſes its ſelf into innumerable ſmall Twigs amongſt the Fibers. In the ſecond place, It has a vein with ſprouts into it from the <hi>Perta,</hi> which is all ſpent and loſt in the ſubſtance of it, except only two arms, the <hi>vas breve,</hi> which goes away to the ſtomack; and the other the Haemorrhoidal vein, which runs away to the <hi>Anus.</hi> The coat of the vein which enters the Spleen (as was firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd (as I take it) by the learend Dr. <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> in the Spleen of an Oxe) the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goes, grows thinner and thinner, till at length it vaniſhes, and nothing of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; and all the way it runs, it is (as it were) boared full of ſome leſſer, ſome larger holes, which receive into them the blood returning out of the <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> and theſe holes, after the manner of veins, branch themſelves into the <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> In the veins, there are evidently to be ſeen Valves, which ſtop and hinder all paſſage and commerce from the <hi>Porta</hi> by the Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick branch to the Spleen; only there may be plainly obſerved an <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> between the upper branches of the vein and Arterie.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, the Spleen is furniſhed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57881:85"/>with Nerves from the Sixth Pare (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ancients, or Eighth, according to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>) which, with their numerous Threds and Fibers, weave themſelves into a kind of Net, upon which the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> ſticks, leaving everywhere multitude of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle holes, which are not unfitly reſembled by thoſe in a Spunge, or Pumy-ſtone, into which the ſmall Arteries running every where diſperſed amongſt the Threds of the Nerves, empty themſelves of the blood; which having paſſed through, and waſhed the whole ſubſtance of the Spleen, is again drunk up, and carried away by the veins.</p>
                  <p>From this deſcription of the Spleen, it ſeems moſt probable, That all this Art and Workmanſhip was beſtowed upon it by Nature, that ſhe might make it a part of ſome eminent and neceſſary uſe, and not deſign it for the ſink or drein of the body, or an idle and unprofitable bowel. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not her cuſtom to be at expence of ſo much skill and pains, to ſo little, or no purpoſe; for it cannot be imagined, that ſhe intended it for the ſeparation of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements and filth, ſince there is not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory veſſel or paſſage to be found which belongs to it.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57881:86"/>
                  <p>Nor is their opinion more likely, who ſuppoſe the Spleen to be as a Bath or Stove to heat and warm the ſtomack with its blood, ſince neither its fibrous conſtitution ſeems proper for ſuch a uſe; nor its ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince in moſt Creatures only one end of it lies near the ſtomack. Beſides, that it is now taken for granted, That concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſtomack is performed by an acid <hi>menſtruum,</hi> rather than heat, and therefore can ſtand in little need of the aſſiſtance of the heat of the Spleen; eſpecially, ſince we find, that Fiſh, and other cold Creatures, diſſolve their meat eaſily, and quickly; and yet upon the opening of them alive, we find no more ſenſible heat in their ſtomacks than in other parts of their bodies. Agreeable to this, I have obſerv'd in the ſtomacks of Mice ſome parts of a Tallow Candle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the bottom of the ſtomack by the <hi>menstruum,</hi> when the reſt that lay up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the upper orifice, was not at all melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the heat.</p>
                  <p>The uſe then for which (from the Make and fabrick of this bowel) it ſeems to be framed by Nature, is this.</p>
                  <p>That the blood brought hither by the <hi>Coeliac</hi> Arteries, paſſing through many turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and windings, and (as it were) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colating through the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> does leave
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57881:86"/>behind it (as Salt-water ſtreined through Earth) ſome ſalt and earthy parts, which after they have undergone ſome alteration by their mutual action one upon another, by their attrition, and juſtling in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the ſeveral Cells, Cavities, and Pores of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> are by the freſh blood which perpetually flows thither by continual Circulation, carried back through the veins into the maſs of blood, in which they ſerve for a moſt uſeful and effectual Ferment. Thus we ſee the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the acid Spirit from Liquors, and in the Liver the ſulphurious or bilious part of the blood is ſeparated into the veſſels of Gall.</p>
                  <p>Now, for the clearer apprehenſion of the manner and way how the Ferment of the Spleen works upon the blood, and other juyces, it will not be improper in this place to take notice of thoſe ordinary and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Ferments which the Bakers and Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers every day offer to our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The learned Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> in his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Treatiſe, <hi>De Fermentatione,</hi> tells us, <hi>That there are two ſorts of Ferments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One, <hi>an Abſolute, of which all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are wonderfully active, and indued with vigorous, and brisk motions; and therefore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57881:87"/>being mingled with any thing which is to be fermented, they ſeize upon the Particles of that body, of what kind ſoever they be; and though they were ſluggiſh and unactive before, hurrie them along with them in their own motions.</hi> Thus Barm, Eggs, and the like, do almoſt in all bodies, with which they can be mingled, cauſe a Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>The other, <hi>is a Reſpective Ferment which conſiſts moſt commonly of Particles of one kind, which will only ferment with Particles of another particular kind and nature, when they chance to meet.</hi> Thus fluid Salts fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with fixed or alcaliſate Salts, as we find, when ſharp Liquors are poured upon Coral, Harts-horn, Shells, Steel; and when Spirit of Vitriol, and Salt of Tartar are mingled together, a great Ebullition does enſue; ſuch a Ferment as this is moſt probably communicated from the Spleen to the blood and juyces. Now, though it muſt be confeſſed, that the ſaline and terreſtrial parts which conſtitute the Splenick Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were actually in the blood before ever that they came to the Spleen; yet were they before that ſo entangled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the other Principles, the watry and earthy Particles of the blood, that they could not then excite thoſe Fermentations
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57881:87"/>which depended upon their proper figures, and genuine motions.</p>
                  <p>But in the percolation of the blood through the porous <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Spleen, the combination of the Principles which conſtitute that Liquor is in a manner diſſolved, and the ſaline and terreſtrial parts are disjoined from the Phlegm and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, to which they were before very cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united; which being free, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at their own diſpoſal; nor any wayes dulled and blunted by the adheſion of thoſe other Principles, and thus digeſted (carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the veins into the maſs of blood) perform thoſe effects in it which are ſutable to their natures; which whilſt they remained in combination with the other Principles, they could not poſſibly produce. For then being by reaſon of their newly acquired Figures not eaſily miſcible with the reſt of the blood, they excite an inteſtine motion of all the little Particles of it; and by that means, deliver the more ſpirituous and fine parts from being too much oppreſſed and choaked up by the more ſluggiſh and groſs; and, in ſhort, work that in the blood which is performed by a little Leven in a huge Tub of Dough. For as a little piece of Dough kept ſo long till it be ſtale and ſowre, ferments the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57881:88"/>whole maſs, and makes it light and rare, which would otherwiſe have been cloſe and heavy; ſo by the mixture of this acid Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spleen, the whole blood is rarefied, made more lively and brisk, and fit to circulate, for the better ſupply of the Natural, Vital, and Animal Conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>That the Blood is after this manner fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the leven of the Spleen, is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argued from the Diſeaſes, which from the obſtructions and ſchirrouſneſs of this Bowel, are wont to enſue; ſuch are <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexies, Dropſies,</hi> and the like Dyſcraſies of the Blood, which neceſſarily happen upon defect of the Spleenick ferment. And it is not unworthy of obſervation, that Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins made of the Spleens of Animals, are recommended to us by Practitioners as proper and effectual for the cure of theſe Diſeaſes. The Decoction of an Oxes Spleen is commended by many Authors; and the Spleen of a Hog, is, by <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> ſaid to be very proper in Crudities and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Digeſtion of the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>And it may well be ſuppoſed that the Saline Particles of the Spleen, taken in by the mouth, and with the Chyle carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Veins and Arteries, have the ſame operation upon the Blood and Bodies of Animals with the Leven of the Spleen,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57881:88"/>when that Bowel is in good order and performs its duty. For that Salts are the moſt proper Bodies to ferment the Blood, is known by every dayes Experience to Phyſitians, who, in Chronical Diſeaſes, perform the moſt conſiderable alterations upon the Blood, and open the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate obſtructions of the Bowels, by the aſſiſtance of the fixed Salts of Vegetables and Minerals. Upon this ſcore the Barks of Trees are ſo much in uſe, becauſe they contain in them a far greater quantity of fixed Salt than the Bodies; And we ſee, that in <hi>Dropſies, Chachexies, Obſtructions,</hi> and the like Diſeaſes, which will not yield to vulgar Medicins, the learnedſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners betake themſelves to Medicins of <hi>Tartar, Steel,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> as a certain Refuge in the greateſt Extremities; and it cannot be imagin'd, how theſe Medicins ſhould perform ſuch certain and admirable effects, but that by fermenting the Blood with their Saline Particles, they ſupply the defect of the natural ferment.</p>
                  <p>For as long as this is vigorous, and the paſſages are open from the Spleen into the maſſe of Blood, the Splenick leven by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually maintaining an inteſtine motion of the ſmall Particles of the Blood, preſerves that Liquor in its due mixture and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57881:89"/>ſo that the groſſer and finer Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, being exactly mingled one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and the Spirits free and at liberty, the Blood is rendered fit to circulate through the moſt ſtreight and narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and not apt to curdle and ſtagnate in the Veſſels. And by this means, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities are concocted, Obſtructions opened, tough and ſlimy humors attenuated, and the Blood defecated of all its Excrements and Impurities, by the vents and emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Body. By this means, not only the Juyces which run in the Veins and Arteries are rich, pure, and ſpirituous, but likewiſe from theſe, a ſoft, ſubtil, and well rectified Spirit and Liquor is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Brain, and diſtributed into the Nerves for the uſe of the Animal Function, and exerciſe of Senſe and Motion in all the Inſtruments and Organs deſigned by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for thoſe uſes.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it is very probable, that the Splenick Ferment does by the Arteries, out of the maſſe of Blood, ſupply the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Bowels, which ſerve for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Aliment, with a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> (not unlike thoſe Liquors, with which the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> diſſolve Mettals and other Bodies) for the diſſolution of meat and reducing it to Chyle. For we cannot with Reaſon,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57881:89"/>aſſign that work to Heat, ſince the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe fire cannot by roaſting, baking, boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any other way of applying of that Element, reduce bread, fleſh, and other meats in many dayes, into a ſubſtance ſo fluid and thin, as the Stomach can in a very few hours.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Spleen (whileſt it diſpenſes a ſincere and rightly elaborated ferment) is a Bowel of great uſe and importance, for the preſervation of the blood and Spirits in their due temper and motion; ſo does it often cauſe very conſiderable diſorders and extravagancies in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Body, when it degenerates from its natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and infects the Humors and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with an impure and ill digeſted Leven. For, that the Blood may duly and orderly ferment and circulate, it is moſt requiſite, that the inteſtine motion of the little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which conſtitute it, be neither too furious and tumultuous, nor too heavy and ſluggiſh. And for this reaſon is it, (as I ſuppoſe) that the fixed Salt is ſeparated from the Blood in the Spleen, and again returned, and mingled with the Maſſe by the Veins. For indeed, fixed Salt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of parts which are indued with ſome kind of Acrimony, and yet being not too ſeverely acid, ſeem to be Bodies moſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57881:90"/>proper to maintain a leiſurely and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ebullition. But if the ferment once grow too ſharp, and acid, and acquire parts, apt to provoke, irritate, and prick the ſenſible parts of the Body, and the fixed Salts become to be fluid, it preſently fects the whole ſtream of the Blood, puts it into violent and diſorderly motions, vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates the nervous parts, fixes the Spirits, puts all the humors into a hurly burly, and makes them apt to congeal and ſtagnate. For when this Ferment is rightly made, it conſiſts of Salt, with the addition of a moderate quantity of earth, by the mutual Conjunction of which fixed Salt is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but, if by any means there be a ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made of the Saline part from the earthy, then are the Salts ſaid to be in the ſtate of fluidity, becauſe they run together into a Liquor, as Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Vitriol, and the like. Thus, when the Ferment of the Spleen becomes fluid, it acquires the fierce ſharpneſs of Vinegar, or Spirit of Vitriol. This is the fault of it in Hypocondriacal Perſons. For, in men who labour of thoſe Diſtempers, all the fixed Salts of the Blood which circulate through the Spleen, are there made fluid, till at length they come to prevail over the other principles of the Blood, and turn the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57881:90"/>whole ſtock of it into a Liquor as ſharp as Vinegar, or Spirit of Vitriol, by which means, all the Spirits are depreſſed and kept under. The ſowre Belches and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Hypocondriacal Perſons, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes are no leſſe ſharp than Spirit of Vitriol, are a very ſufficient argument of the ſharpneſs of their Juices, which prick and tear their ſtomachs, bowels, and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts with continual pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ſometimes with their Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding acidity flea their Tongues, Throats, and Lips.</p>
                  <p>And the violent and irregular motions, and boylings of the blood, do very eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently convince, that the Conſtitution of that Liquor in Hypochondriacal Perſons is become ſharp and eager; For we find it moſt true from ſundry expriments that ſuch tumultuous Ebullitions are cauſed from the mixture of fluid Salts with fixed: and in Liquors, which are void of fluid Salts, we meet with no ſuch fermentations; or where they are but in ſmall quantity mingled, the fermentation is leſſe, and more leiſurely and nothing ſo tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>In quick-Lime, and Juices which abound with acid Salt, as ſoon as the fluid and fixed meet with one another, preſently a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57881:91"/>noiſe, heat and boyling do enſue. Thus we ſee Salt of Wormwood, Scurvy-graſs, or the like; Coral, Pearl, Oyſter-ſhells, and other teſtacious bodies; when Spirit of Vitriol, Sulphur, juyce of Lemons, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, Oranges, or any acid liquor is poured upon them, preſently fall a boyling and hiſſing.</p>
                  <p>Many more Inſtances of this kind may be given, but becauſe they are obvious to every man who is in the leaſt verſed in Chymical operations, I will paſs them by, and farther endeavor to prove from the way of cure of Hypochondriacal Diſtempers, by the Medicins moſt approved, and famed by the beſt and moſt learned Authors, <hi>That the cauſe of thoſe affections, conſiſts in a ſharp and eager Diſtemper of the Blood and Juyces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Remedies which in this caſe are moſt commended, are ſuch as conſiſt of Steel, Tartar, Vitriol, fixed Salts, and all teſtaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bodies, as likewiſe diuretical Remedies, which abounding with fixed Salts, do very much precipitate the blood. For we find by Experience, That theſe Medicins do ſweeten all ſharp Liquors, and abate their Pungency; for the Acrimony of Salts is not blunted by Sulphurious, but Saline bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; by reaſon that fixed Salts by an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57881:91"/>and cloſe union to the fluid, do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tund their points and edges, as a thick piece of Steel exactly fitted to the blade of a Knife, will abate the cutting or dividing power of the edge. Thus the corroding ſharpneſs of Spirit of Virriol is taken away by Salt of Tartar or Wormwood. <hi>Habet</hi> (ſays <hi>Fonſeca) Sal Tartari magnam vim domandi humores melancholicos &amp; atros: nam trahit ad ſe proprietate quadam accetoſitates, &amp; ſi aceti fortiſſimi</hi> lb iiii <hi>cum</hi> ℥i. <hi>Tartari vini deſtilletur per ignem, aqua ſine ulla aciditate exibit.</hi> And truly it is very probable, that the reaſon why Melancholy perſons find ſo much benefit from Medicins of Tartar, is, that by ſweetning of the blood and juyces after the ſame manner as that dulcifies Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, the Tartar frees the body from thoſe inconveniencies which are cauſed by their Pungency and Acrimony.</p>
                  <p>From this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> an account may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rationally be given, why Medicins of Steel are uſed with very good ſucceſs, as well in Cachectical, and Hydropical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, in which uſually the Splenick Ferment is deficient; as in Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal, and Scorbutical Diſeaſes, in which that Leven is too plentifully abounding, and too highly exalted. For the vitriolick Salt of Steel (in which much of the force and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57881:92"/>virtue of that Mineral reſides) is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſubſtituted to ſupply the defect of a Ferment to the blood; and likewiſe the ſame Salt (when the blood is become ſharp and eager, and overcome by too large a quantity of fluid, and acid Salt) does (as Salt of Tartar works upon Spirit of Vitriol, or Vineger) abate its Acrimony, and ſweeten the whole maſs.</p>
                  <p>It may now be time that I ſhould more particularly explain the manner, how the blood and humors of the body, by paſſing through the Spleen, do from that ſoft, ſweet, and balſamick conſtitution (which naturally is in ſound and healthy perſons) degenerate into a Liquor altogether harſh, ſharp and unpleaſant to the nervous parts of the body. And for the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the way how this alteration is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is very neceſſary to look back to that deſcription, which I have in the beginning of this Diſcourſe given, of the Make and Fabrick of the Spleen. To wit, <hi>That the Spleen conſists of a great many Arteries, not ſo many Veins; and of a multitude of fibrous Threds, upon which the</hi> Parenchyma, <hi>like Clots of blood, does everywhere ſtick faſt, leaving little ſpaces, or pores, here and there interſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the parts of it throughout the whole ſubſtance of that Bowel.</hi>

                  <p>I ſuppoſe then, the little ſpaces or vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Spleen, to be of ſuch a figure and ſize as is unproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the ſhape of the ſaline Particles of the Blood, as long as any Sulphur or Phlegm ſticks to them; and therefore they are not admitted to paſs along with the reſt of the Blood, out of the Arteries into the Veins; but deteined ſo long in the little Cells or Cavities of the Spleen, till by the frequent Circulations of the Blood, and the Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and juſtling of the Salts againſt the more ſolid parts of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> they become free from the Phlegm and Sulphut which was join'd to them; from which other Principles as ſoon as they are diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, they do very readily and eaſily paſs along with the Blood which is circulated through the Spleen, as being then very ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the figures of the Pores or Paſſages; to which, as long as they were united to thoſe other Principles, they were not in the leaſt agreeable. The fixed Salts thus prepar'd in the Spleen, and paſſing from thence by the veins into the maſs of Blood, ſerve to impregnate and ferment the Liquors of the body, and to preſerve them in their due mixture and motions.</p>
                  <p>As long as the ſmall Paſſages in the Spleen remain free and open, and that the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57881:93"/>ſubſtance or <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of it is not grown ſo hard and earthy, as to alter the natural poſition and ſhape of the Pores, or little Spaces in it; the ſupply of a well prepar'd Ferment to the Blood, is duly and regularly perform'd. But if either from a natural melancholy conſtitution, or errors in dyer, the ſubſtance of the Spleen be rendered too compact, ſolid, and earthy, and the Pores or Spaces are altered from their natural Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Magnitude.</p>
                  <p>The ſaline Particles in their Percolation through the Spleen, are ſo worn and grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they are not only ſeparated from the Sulphur and Phlegm (which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the making of a fit Ferment) but likewiſe forcibly disjoin'd from the earthy Principle (without which they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main fixed, but preſently become fluid) And then, inſtead of a Ferment, which ſhould maintain in the Blood and Humors an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and moderate Ebullition, aſharp, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and pungent Liquor is ſent into the Blood, which puts it into irregular and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Fermentations, and puts the whole frame of the body into diſorder.</p>
                  <p>That this is the fault of the Spleen in Hypochondriacal perſons, ſeems to me the more probable, for that it is obſerv'd, <hi>That ſar guin and phlegmatick Complexions are very
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57881:93"/>rarely troubled with diſtempers of this nature; and that even they who are naturally of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy temperament, fall not into them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they arrive at a ripeneſs of Age, when the Blood begins to be aduſt, and the Spleen to grow earthy and black; whereas in thoſe who are very young, it is of a lively red colour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is worthy obſervation, That this fault or diſeaſe of the Spleen, is ſeldom, or never, perfectly cur'd; and therefore the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicins do only by ſweetning the Blood, ſo long allay the Symptoms and Diſorders of it, till the maſs becomes again infected with acidities from the Spleen; and therefore perſons who have been once troubled with Hypochondriacal diſtempers, do uſually pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodically relapſe into them.</p>
                  <p>From hence, it will be no very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to give an account of the cauſes of the particular Symptoms and Accidents which accompany the Hypochondriacal diſtemper. They concern either the Natural, Vital, or Animal Faculties.</p>
                  <p>As to the Natural, the appetite to meat, is often (by reaſon of the ſharpneſs of the Ferment in the ſtom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ck) too extravagant; and yet the meat is ill digeſted, and much of it turn'd ſometimes into a ſowre water; at other, into tough ſlime, by reaſon that the extraordinary ſharpneſs of the Ferment
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57881:94"/>makes it unproportionable and unfit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Aliment; for, that this may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon ſuch a ſcore, the obſervation of the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> does ſufficiently evince, who find,
<note place="margin">Berigard. Circ. Piſan.</note> 
                     <hi>Menſtruum nimis acidum metallum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um non ſolvere.</hi> From the ſame cauſe, they who labour of this diſtemper, are troubled with continual ſpitting, loathing, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vomiting; the ſtomack being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and convell'd by the gnawing acidity of its <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> They are uſually hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in their bodies, and ſeldom go to ſtool; partly, by reaſon that the Paſſages from the Gall are obſtructed (one uſe of Choler being to irritate the Guts, and cauſe them to thruſt out their Excrements) and partly, for that the <hi>Pancreas</hi> (as <hi>Riverius</hi> obſerves) is uſually affected in this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and does not furniſh the Guts with a Ferment. For it is very probable, that by <hi>Wirſungius</hi> his paſſage, a Liquor is ſent into the Guts, which mingling with the Bile, ſerves there to ferment the Aliment.</p>
                  <p>The faeces in ſuch perſons are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very black, by reaſon of the vitriolick acidity, which mingled with the Salts of the meat, produces that colour, as we ſee Ink is made by the mixture of the Salts of Galls and Vitriol.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:57881:94"/>
                  <p>Their Urine is generally very highly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, like a ſtrong Lie; for that much of the Salt being not ſufficiently volatiliſed, and breath'd out through the Pores, is ſent down in the <hi>Serum</hi> through the urinary Paſſages. When the Urine comes away thin and white, it is for the moſt part, the certain forerunner of a Fit; for that either the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line parts are carried up to the head, and flung upon the Nerves; or becauſe the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fluid Salts meeting together, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and ferment with one another; and coagulating together, are not diſſolved in the Whey of the Blood; and ſo that runs through the Kidneys clear, and without any tincture from the Salts.</p>
                  <p>As to the Vital Faculty, they find often about their breaſt, a great oppreſſion, ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and difficulty of breathing, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall into Aſthmatical Paroxyſms: Moreover, they complain of a trembling and palpitation of the heart, of a great weight and oppreſſion at it, ſo that they every minute apprehend they are a dying. All which Symptoms proceed partly from the ſharpneſs of the nervous juyce which grates and vellicates the Nerves, and is apt to ſtagnate in them; and partly, from the Blood, which is not well and regularly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the heart.</p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:57881:95"/>
                  <p>In relation to the Animal Faculty, there are very few Symptoms in this Diſeaſe which do not owe their original, either to the brain, or the nervous parts, or elſe to the nervous juyce. From hence proceed acute and wandring pains, about the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtin, and Shoulders, and ſometimes ſuch as imitate the colick and nephritick Paſſions. From hence are often Apoplexies, Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Palſies, Giddineſs, Watchings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Sleeps, and many other Symptoms, which are cauſed from the diſorder of the Animal Faculty.</p>
                  <p>Now, the head and nervous parts are two ſeveral ways affected from the diſtemper of the Spleen.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Blood made ſowre andca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by the Spleen, a Liquor is diſtributed to the brain and nervous parts, infected with the ſame harſh and ungrateful quality, which perpetually grates, and provokes thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſenſible parts:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond way, by which the brain is affected from the Spleen, is, when the extremities of the Nerves, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed throughout that part, are pricked, twitched, and vellicated, by ſharp juyces which are lodged in that Bowel; from whence Convulſions are communicated to the brain, and nervous Syſtem; by which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57881:95"/>means, the Spirits are put into diſorder and confuſion in their very fountain and original; and being tumultuouſly darted into the branches of the Nerves, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one part, ſometimes in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, cauſe violent and convulſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſtory in <hi>Tulpius,</hi> of a man, whoſe Spleen was fill'd with ſo ſharp and pungent a Liquor, that if the part were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed by the hand, his Brain, and whole nervous Syſtem were preſently drawn into conſent. <hi>Lien in eo</hi> (ſayes that Author) <hi>a turgido atrae bilis fermento jam tumidus diffudit illico ex ſe vapores cerebro tam ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micos, ut juvenis protinus concideret in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimos morbi comitialis inſultus. Nam preſſa vel ſolo digito regione lienis, contrahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur illico omnes nervi, &amp; ſequebatur confeſtim miſerabilis totius corporis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is now high time to return to <hi>M. N.</hi> and to tell him, <hi>That he very unreaſonably vents his Gall upon the Phyſitians, for treating of bilious or cholerick Complexions and Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> For, though according to <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Sylvius,</hi> Bile may be very uſeful in ſome parts of the body; yet in reſpect of others, it may be an Excrement; and though it may
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57881:96"/>ſerve for a uſeful Ferment in the Guts, yet too great a quantity of it in the Blood, may cauſe a Diſeaſe, and indicate an Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>I Have in the foregoing Chapters prov'd, <hi>that many of the Methods, Medicines, and Terms of the Ancients, are to be retained, and that many of their Notions about Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, will as well ſuit with the Modern, as they did with Ancient ſuppoſitions.</hi> The buſineſſe of this Chapter is, to ſhew, that the particulars offer'd by <hi>M. N.</hi> in his eighth Chapter, do not either at all, or elſe no more than the Notions by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected conduce to the practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
               <p>And firſt, he offers it to our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that Diſeaſes, like</hi> Pompions <hi>and</hi> Turnips <hi>do grow from their peculiar Seeds; and that the diſtemperatures which we find in our Bodies, are but the bloſſoms, fruits, and products of them; and that they, like Animals, ingender and propagate their kinds.</hi> This opinion is taken from <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and <hi>Severinus Danus,</hi> and concerning the Origination of theſe Seminalities, they Phanatickly talk after this manner: They tell us, <hi>That though at
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57881:98"/>the firſt Creation, when by the Divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, all Seeds of things received the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of generating and multiplying, they were pure, entire, and perfect, and free from corruption and death; Yet after the fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>by a Curſe of the Creator, new tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures were added to thoſe pure Seeds, by which mixture the Beauty of the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was deform'd, and the pure Seeds of things were inveſted with new and pernicious Habits and Properties; and that theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Seeds, received from the ſame Divine impreſſion and word, from which the purer and more perfect did, powers and faculties of multiplying and tranſplanting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſum of what <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Severines</hi> deliver, concerning the Seeds of Diſeaſes, and out of them, the reſt of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> who treat of them, have borrowed their notions. But the Opinion ſeems ſo Phantaſtical and Extravagant to all ſober <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> that they have wholly rejected it as a whimſy, and have with much more reaſon, deduced the cauſes of Diſeaſes, from the Exorbitancies and Combination either of three, or five Chymical Principles.</p>

               <p>The next point which <hi>M. N.</hi> would have conſidered, as of great importance to the practice of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> is, <hi>to increaſe the number of Concoctions and Digeſtions of Aliment, which the Ancients have aſſigned to be but three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, if we conſider the grand diſſolution, alteration, and appoſition of the nouriſhment, the diviſion of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57881:99"/>will be found ſufficiently comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; For the great and remarkable alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Aliment, are the diſſolving it into Chyle, the changing of that Chyle into Blood, and the appoſition of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Particles of the Blood, to augment and nouriſh the Bulk. But if we reckon the ſeparations and impregnations made in all parts of the Body, the generation of Spirits, the particular nutrition of each di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Similar part, for Digeſtions and Concoctions of Aliment, (which, I think, is much too nice), I know not why there may not be aſſigned a hundred, or more.</p>
               <p>But, by the way, how many ſoever there be, <hi>M. N.</hi> might very well have ſpar'd ſome of his kinds of Concoction. For through his ignorance of the Lacteals, he readily aſſents to a Concoction made in the Veins of the Meſentery; and in this, he ſayes, the old <hi>Stagers</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> agree. From hence it may be well obſerv'd, that <hi>M. N.</hi> for want of inſight into the true grounds of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> moſt commonly very eaſily ſwallows down the groſſeſt Errors of the Ancients, and uſually picks a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with them in matters where no fault is to be found. But, to mend the matter, he tells us, <hi>that the third Concoction is farther elaborated in the common Receptacle inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:57881:99"/>by <hi>Pecquet.</hi> Now, (to let it paſſe that matters of Anatomy are not properly ſaid to be the Objects of Invention, but Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very) it is very ſhreudly to be ſuſpected, that he knows nothing of that paſſage but by hearſay; for if he had been converſant in diſſections, he would have known, that the Chyle in that Receptacle differs not from that in the Lacteals; and that the ſwift paſſage of it through that Channel into the Subclavials, together with the formation of that Veſſel, do ſufficiently argue, that it receives not any alteration there, worthy the name of a Concoction, all that is imaginable, being the mixture of the Serum which returns from the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, through the <hi>Communis ductus</hi> into the Blood.</p>
               <p>As to this third particular, concerning Ferments, though I allow that term to be of excellent uſe, for that it has been of late imployed by learned men, to convey to the underſtanding an eaſy and familiar apprehenſion of the operations of nature, by referring it to the common and obvious arts of Brewing and Baking. Yet till the nature and operations of the Ferments of every part come to be more particularly explained, and more intelligibly diſcours'd of, than they are by <hi>M. N.</hi> I do not ſee
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57881:100"/>that his Pratling about Ferments, will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conduce to the Practice of Phyſick, than Quality, Power, Virtue, Property, and the like terms of the <hi>Galeniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Particular which <hi>M. N.</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, as of grand concern in the Practice of Phyſick, is the Notion of <hi>Helmont,</hi> who, (as he ſays) <hi>makes a Diſeaſe, a real ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial thing, inherent in that which he calls the</hi> Archaeus, <hi>or vital Spirit.</hi> In which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Diſeaſe, he abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces us of his want of Logick, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That one real ſubſtantial thing, or body, inheres in another:</hi> Since the term <hi>Inheſion</hi> is only proper to expreſs the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Notion of the union of an accident with a ſubſtance; and ſo one material ſubſtance cannot be conceived to inhere in another, without allowing a penetration of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>And now he comes in the fifth place, to deſcribe what this Bug-bear the <hi>Archaeus</hi> is, and tells us, <q>That it is a thing very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to be conceived, that it is <hi>Medium quid inter vitam &amp; corpus, &amp; veluti auro nit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </q> And, why not as well <hi>Medium quid inter corpus &amp; mortem?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>M.N.</hi> muſt have a very delicate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if he can make ſenſe of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; for I think the Nature of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57881:100"/>
                  <hi>Archaeus</hi> is every jot as intelligibly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe <hi>Verſes,</hi> which were made in imitation of the myſterious and aenigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expreſſions of the <hi>Chymiſts.</hi>

                     </l>
                  </q> All that any ſober man can conceive of the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> or Spirit, is, That it is the moſt fine, volatil, and aethereal part of the blood, contained in the Arteries, Veins, and Nerves; and I grant, that the Dyſcraſie of the blood, their Vehicle, is the cauſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſeaſes.

               <p>As to his Quotations out of <hi>Fernelius</hi> and <hi>Heurnius,</hi> thoſe Authors ſpeak no more, than what is ſaid by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and all their Followers, <hi>That the Spirits, the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the learned <hi>Sennertus</hi> (though he allow <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and his Diſciples, to impoſe new words upon new things) juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blames them, <hi>For introducing new, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, inſignificant, and barbarous terms, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notions and things anciently receiv'd;</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>IN his Ninth <hi>Chapter, M. N.</hi> proceeds to an examination of divers old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which more immediately relate to the Practice of Phyſick; and firſt, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiers the Doctrine about Critical days, <hi>which he calls as childiſh a conceit, as ever was owned by any Long-beards, called the Children of Men.</hi> But I ſhall plainly prove, That this Doctrine is not ſo eaſily to be blown away, being of ſo abſolute neceſſity to the true management of Fevers, that except a diligent heed be had to the Critical moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Diſeaſes, the beſt and moſt proper Remedies prove as dangerous to the ſick, as a drawn Sword in the hands of a blind man, who lays about him at random, and knows not upon whom, or where the edge will light. For, though the Ancients poſſibly might be ignorant of the true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Critical motions of Diſeaſes, that did no more hinder them from making true obſervations upon them, than the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of Philoſophers concerning the reaſons of the Fluxes, and Refluxes of the Sea, does cauſe Mariners to be ignorant of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57881:103"/>what Tides will carry them into and out of ſeveral Harbors.</p>
               <p>And, though it muſt be confeſſed, that in theſe Northern Countries wherein we live, Fevers are neither ſo conſtantly, nor ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly terminated by Critical Evacuations, as punctually to agree with the deſcriptions of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen;</hi> by reaſon that in this colder Climate (which is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally liable to alterations from the Air) the Blood when it is fired into a Fever, does not burn with ſo equal and conſtant a flame; and therefore cannot obſerve ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the times and periods of its burning, and conſuming the ſulphureous or combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible part. And for that the Blood of moſt Perſons being tainted with the Scurvy, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo eaſily concoct, and at once ſeparate the aduſt Recrements; but that they are often, inſtead of being Critically evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, tranſlated upon the brain, and nervous parts.</p>
               <p>Yet is not the Credit of thoſe grave Authors, by every impertinent Man, to be called into queſtion, concerning the truth of the obſervations which they made upon the motions, and burning of Fevers, in the Countries wherein they liv'd, and practis'd Phyſick; ſince they have been always repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the moſt Learned, of unſuſpected
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57881:103"/>Faith and integrity in delivering matters of fact, which fell under their own notice.</p>
               <p>And indeed, if we conſider the true cauſes of critical Evacuations, we cannot queſtion, but that, in continual putri'd Feavers, in thoſe parts of the World, in which, neither the coldneſſe of the Air, nor the Scorbutick diſtemper made the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) Nature was as preciſe in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her periods, as ſhe uſes to be with us in Quotidians, Tertians, and Quartans.</p>
               <p>For indeed, a <hi>Criſis</hi> in a continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is the very ſame with a <hi>Paroxyſm</hi> in an <hi>Intermittent,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> very well obſerves:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Willis de Feb.</hi> c. 9.</note> for (ſayes he) as in an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent, when the maſs of blood is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, with the Particles of the deprav'd Alimentary juice, which can by no means be ſubdued and aſſimilated, that falls aworking and by its fermentation, depurates its ſelf and ſends out by the pores of the skin the heterogenious matter; ſo, in a continual Feaver from the burning of the Blood and Alimentary juice much aduſt matter is mingled with the Blood, which, (when it amounts to ſo great a quantity as to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that active Liquor) Nature, as ſoon as there is the leaſt reſpite from burning, by degrees ſubdues, then ſeparates, and at laſt endeavours to exterminate out of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57881:104"/>the Body the morbifick matter.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as the fits of Intermittent Feavers invade at ſet times, and at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a certain number of hours; ſo critical motions, obſerve either the fourth or ſeventh day, by reaſon, that in ſuch a ſpace of time, the fired Blood has done burning, and being overcharged with aduſt matter, or aſhes, Nature, by the offenſive irritation of it, is provoked to a <hi>Criſis.</hi> And (continues that learned Author) if the matter can be eaſily ſeparated from the Blood, and that the pores of the skin be ſufficiently free and open, the aduſt matter is together with the ſerous part of the Blood, thruſt out of the Body by ſweat; and this is much the beſt way of <hi>Criſis:</hi> for if it ſucceed aright, very often at once, in one ſingle conflict, it puts an end to the Diſeaſe, without any danger of a Relapſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Criſis</hi> next beſt to this, is that which is perform'd by an Haemorrhage. For the aduſt matter moving about with the Blood, is (if it cannot be vented by ſweat) transferred upon one part or other, as far diſtant as may be from the heart, and not ſeldome violently hurried up to the head, from whence (if the paſſages be open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Noſtrils) the morbifick matter, burſts forth, together with the Blood: but
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57881:104"/>if it finds no paſſage, it remains fix'd upon the Brain, and there enſues a Phrenſie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium, or ſome other dangerous Diſtemper of that part. There are likewiſe other wayes of a <hi>Criſis,</hi> by which nature endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to expell the febril matter, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely all at once, but by degrees, and by ſundry attempts, ſome part at one time, and ſome at another, ſometimes by Urine, ſometimes by Vomit, or Stool, by Spots, Pimples, Botches, and the like; but what way ſoever ſhe takes, it is requiſite (if we expect any happy event) that the burning of the Blood be over, that the aduſt matter be concocted and rendred fit to be ſeparated.</p>
               <p>He goes on and tells us, that the ſtate of the Diſeaſe is of one kind and Simple, and alwayes after the ſame manner, but with a very different variety of Symptoms, and with a tendency to Events which are very divers. But, notwithſtanding this, it is requiſite, that a prudent Phyſitian be able to paſs his prognoſtick in what time the Diſeaſe will come to the ſtate, and what iſſue it may be like to have.</p>
               <p>If the Fever from the beginning be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of a ſudden fires the whole maſs of blood; if with fierce Symptoms, it conſtantly and equally continue burning, without any remiſſion, moſt commonly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57881:105"/>within four days there will have been ſo great a deflagration of the blood, that the aduſt matter, which is to provoke the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> will arrive at its due fulneſs and turgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. But if the beginning be more mild and ſlow, and the burning of the blood oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en interrupted, the Fever will not come to its heighth before the ſeventh day. But if the beginning be yet more ſluggiſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, the ſtate of the Diſeaſe uſes not to happen before the Eleventh or Fourteenth day.</p>
               <p>Now although a perfect <hi>Criſts</hi> happen not ſometimes before the Fourteenth, Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, or perhaps the Twentieth day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before that time, all the requiſite conditions to the perfect judgment of the Diſeaſe do not concur; yet in the mean time, ſome ſlight skirmiſhes happen, by which the aduſt matter growing to a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is by degrees ſomething emptied, till Nature can be in a condition to attempt the diſcuſſing of the whole. But foraſmuch as during the burning of the blood, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally within the ſpace of four days, great ſtore of aduſt matter is increaſed within the Veſſels, Nature (except ſhe be by ſome accident diſturb'd) is every fourth day provoked by the fulneſs of the matter, to free her ſelf from her burden.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:57881:105"/>
               <p>Wherefore moſt commonly on the Fourth, Seventh, Eleventh, and Fourteenth days, not from the influence of the Planets, but from a neceſſity in Nature, ſome Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal motions uſe to happen.</p>
               <p>This account of Critical days, and the reaſons of them, I have taken out of Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> his Book, <hi>De Febribus;</hi> and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I may do him right in relation to his judgment of the Doctrine of Critical days, ſince <hi>M. N.</hi> by quoting three or four words out of him, without taking any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the reſt of his Diſcourſe, would fain ſlighly inſinuate, that this learned man is of his opinion; but he has not only ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared himſelf to the contrary, in the places by me already quoted, but elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in his Pharmaceutick directions.</p>
               <p>And now, let any man judge, whether the Doctrine of Critical days be to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhier'd, as of no uſe in Phyſick; when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the poor Patient, who in a Fever commits himſelf to a Phyſitian ignorant of the times and motions of the Diſeaſe, runs the ſame hazard with a ſhip expos'd to the Ocean without a Pilot, which is by the ſame Sails; which well managed, would have carried it into a ſafe Harbor, driven upon a Rock, and haſtned to its Ruine. For though it be granted, That Fevers are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57881:106"/>extinguiſhed in the beginning, by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable bleeding, vomiting, or gentle purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as occaſion ſhall require; yet, by <hi>M.

               <p>Now ſince he is reſolved to cavil with the Ancients, for leaving to us too elaborate and acurate a Doctrine of the Pulſe, he muſt give me leave to tell him, That if they Treat too nicely of the matter, he handles it much too looſely and ſlovenly. For certainly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57881:106"/>there is no Phyſitian who has been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to handle the Pulſe of ſick men, and has not his fingers conſtantly benum'd; but has diſcern'd in the beating of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, not only the abſolute, but likewiſe the reſpective differences of Motions or Pulſes.</p>

Nay, the Pulſe is of ſo great importance in Fevers, that if it on a ſudden alter for the worſe (though all other Symptoms promiſe well) it is a diſmal forerunner of death; and upon the other hand, if that continue good, though all other Symptoms threaten ill,

                  <hi>than by a Wiſe man to a Gypſie, who croſſes his hand to tell his Forune,</hi> is as abſurd, as to conclude, from the variation of the Needle, that it is of no uſe in Navigation, or to affirm, that Watches are not uſeful to meaſure Time, becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental cauſes, as moiſt weather, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or riding with them in the Pocket, or the like, may in ſome ſort retard, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate their motions. The Methodiſts have been ſo careful, that in their Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they treat of the Pulſe, they acquaint us with what accidents may make an alteration in them. Therefore <hi>Senner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and other writers of Inſtitutions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, that the Phyſitian do not, as ſoon as he comes to the Patient, preſently feel his pulſe, but ſtay till the motions which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57881:109"/>the preſence of the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> has rais'd in his affections be over, and that then, when he is ſedate and quiet, and free from paſſion, he examin the pulſe; and then neither, not preſently when he has been ſtirred, but after the diſturbance which was caus'd in his Body by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him be over; then, that the Hand of the Patient be free from all voluntary motion, that the Fingers be not too much bent or ſtretched, that the Hand be not ſuſtained by the Patients own ſtrength, leſt it tremble, and alter the pulſe; and then that the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is to try the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of holding the Wriſt upward or downward or Sidewayes, and that he muſt have frequently accuſtom'd himſelf to try the pulſes of men in health, and (if it can be done) to learn what ſort of pulſe his Patient had when his Body was in good order.</p>
               <p>From theſe, and ſeveral other Cautions given by the Learned, it appears, That though the Ancients held the Doctrine of Pulſes to be of great concern in the curing of Diſeaſes, yet they apprehended many difficulties, in giving an infallible determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their ſignifications; and they ſeem no more to have believ'd, that every rude hand (which can only ſcribble an ill
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57881:109"/>Book) could paſs a true Judgment upon the Pulſe, than a wiſe man will credit the Fortune which is told him by a Gypſie; which ſort of Vagabonds (by the way) are reckoned up by <hi>Camerarius</hi> in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Mountebanks and Empericks: And truly I think with good reaſon: for their Predictions are as much to be relied upon, as <hi>M. N</hi>'s Phyſick; and therefore they may be both well ranked together, ſince he and they (though by different methods) drive at the ſame end; for as they with their <hi>Pedlers French,</hi> and croſſing the hand, he with his <hi>Pox,</hi> and Canting, amuſes the credulous Vulgar, that he may with the leſs ſuſpition proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his grand deſign upon their Pockets.</p>
               <p>I will now conclude, and diſmiſs the Author of <hi>Medela,</hi> whoſe Book (though very ſlight and trivial) I have all along in this Treatiſe taken notice of, for that it pretends to argue, from the new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries which have been made of late in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and, from I know not what ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary change in the nature of all Diſeaſes, that the old way of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> in reſpect of Method and Medicins, is become inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and uſeleſſe, and therefore the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of it to be demoliſhed, and a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous <hi>Chimaera</hi> of his own ſubſtituted in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57881:110"/>their room. Whereas, the modern Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in Anatomy and Chymiſtry, are ſo far from deſtroying the Practice and Method of the Ancients, that they very firmly corroborate, and eſtabliſh their Doctrines, by furniſhing us with the true reaſons of thoſe Proceſſes and Methods which were delivered down to us from them, only upon their experience and knowledge of the matter of Fact, though they were ignorant of the true cauſes. Thus we know the Ligature in letting of blood was alwayes uſed by the Chyrurgions, though the reaſon of it was never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, before the Circulation of the blood was diſcovered. Moſt of the Doctrines in the Therapeutick part of Phyſick, are like this, founded upon experience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the improvements in the <hi>Phyſiology,</hi> and <hi>Pathology</hi> of that Art, will not (as <hi>M. N.</hi> would have it) deſtroy, but illuſtrate them: Wherefore in the reforming of Phyſick, and ſuiting an Inſtitution to the late Diſcoveries in <hi>Anatomy</hi> and <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that we imitate wiſe and thrifty Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who, in raiſing a new Houſe in the place of an old one which they have pull'd down, make uſe of many of the old ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Materials, ſome of which are often much the better for their age.</p>
